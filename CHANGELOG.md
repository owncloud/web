   We have updated the loading spinner on the initial page load to run continuously
   during the client bootstrap. Previously, the spinner would appear and disappear
   multiple times.

   Additionally, we have aligned the spinner's design with our other loading
   spinners and reduced the delay before it appears from 1 second to 0.5 seconds.

* Bugfix - Context menu empty in tiles view: [#10900](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10900)

   We've fixed a bug where the context menu was empty in the tiles view after
   clicking the show context menu button

* Bugfix - Disable search in public link context: [#10928](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10928)

   We've fixed a bug where the search was visible in the public link context but
   not usable, since we are not able yet to provide searching in this context.
   Therefore the search was disabled in the public link context.

* Bugfix - Local logout if IdP has no logout support: [#10974](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10974)

   Some IdPs don't support a logout endpoint. In those cases the web UI ran into a
   fatal error and showed an empty screen without further redirects. Fixed by
   forgetting the currently authenticated user when the OpenID Connect
   configuration doesn't contain an `endSessionEndpoint` url.

* Change - Remove skeleton app: [#9892](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9892)

   Due to improvements in the extension system in general, we have removed the
   skeleton app. Documentation regarding the extension API and guides/examples can
   be found in the dev docs.

* Change - Remove deprecated extension point for adding quick actions: [#10102](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10102)

   BREAKING CHANGE for developers: The old way of registering quick actions via the
   `quickaction` property of an app has been removed. Quick actions should be
   registered as extension via our extension registry. They need to be of type
   `action` and have the `app.files.quick-action` extensionPointId.

* Change - Remove homeFolder option: [#10122](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10122)

   We have removed the `homeFolder` option as it was originally implemented and
   used by CERN but isn't needed anymore.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10122

* Change - Vuex store removed: [#10210](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/10210)

   BREAKING CHANGE for developers: The vuex store has been removed in favor of
   pinia.

   All store modules have been migrated to a pinia store module. Please see the
   linked issue down below for a list of all migrated stores and how to use them
   now.

   There are a number of things that have been removed and/or moved into pinia
   composables instead:

   Globals:

   - `store` and `$store` variables have been removed. - `ConfigurationManager` has
   been removed. The config now sits inside the configuration store.

   App framework:

   - `announceStore` has been removed. There is no need for apps to announce stores
   to the runtime. If you need to use a store in your app, simply create a pinia
   store module and use it. - `announceExtensions` has been removed. The proper way
   for an app to register file extensions is via the `extensions` property inside
   the `appInfo` object. - `requestStore` has been removed. There is no need to
   request specific stores. All stores that `web-pkg` provides can be imported and
   accessed via their composables. - `enabled` callback as well as the `name`
   callback of the `AppNavigationItem` no longer have the `capabilities` parameter.
   - `store` param of the `ClassicApplicationScript` has been removed.

   Composables:

   - `useStore` has been removed. Use the pinia for the store you want to use
   instead. - `useAccessToken` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store.
   - `usePublicLinkContext` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store. -
   `usePublicLinkPassword` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store. -
   `usePublicLinkToken` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store. -
   `useUserContext` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store. -
   `useConfigurationManager` has been removed. The config now sits inside the
   configuration store. - `use...Capability` composables have been removed.
   Capablities now sit inside the capability store.

   For store specific changes please see the linked issue and PRs down below.

* Change - Remove ocs user: [#10240](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10240)

   BREAKING CHANGE for developers: The user from the ocs api has been removed in
   favor of the graph user. That means the user that can be retrieved from the
   store looks slightly different than the OCS user (though it still holds the same
   information).

   For more details please see the linked PR down below.

* Change - Registering app file editors: [#10330](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10330)

   BREAKING CHANGE for developers: The `announceExtensions` method inside the app's
   `ready` hook, which could be used to register file editors, has been removed.
   Developers should use the `extensions` property inside the `appInfo` object
   instead.

   Note that the `handler` property of such an extension has been renamed to
   `createFileHandler`.

* Change - Add extensionPoint concept: [#10443](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10443)

   BREAKING CHANGE for developers: The `scopes` property has been removed from the
   `Extension` type in favour of the new `extensionPointIds` property.

   The extension system now allows developers to register extension points. An
   extension point defines the metadata for the integration of a certain extension
   type in a certain context. Examples for extension points are render targets for
   custom components, targets for file actions (e.g. the right click context menu,
   the batch actions, the whitespace context menu), etc.

   Extensions can now specify that they are only valid for a certain or multiple
   extension points. This way a file action extension can e.g. specify to be
   rendered only in the context menu, but not in the batch actions. Consequently,
   the extension points concept is the next iteration of the `scopes` concept. The
   `scopes` concept has been removed from the codebase.

   Extension points can define if users should be able to choose preferences for
   the extension point. E.g. for the global progress bar extension point, users can
   choose which of the available progress bar extensions should be used, since the
   extension point only allows one extension to be active. At the moment we persist
   the user choice in the localStorage of the browser.

* Change - Portal target removed: [#10758](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10758)

   BREAKING CHANGE for developers: The (undocumented) portal target
   `app.runtime.header` is not available anymore. Please use the extension point
   `app.runtime.header.center` with `customComponent` extensions instead (for
   details see below).

   The portal target `app.runtime.header` has been removed in favour of a new
   extension point with the id `app.runtime.header.center`. The extension point is
   capable of mounting extensions of type `customComponent`. The search bar, which
   was previously using this portal target, was rewired into an extension. Other
   `portal` instances which used this portal target won't work anymore and need to
   be ported to the `customComponent` extension type instead.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10758

* Change - Disable opening files in embed mode: [#10786](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10786)

   We have disabled to open files in the embed mode, since opening or editing files
   is not in scope of the embed mode.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10172

* Enhancement - Tile sizes: [#10018](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/10018)

   We've adjusted the tile sizes to have a bigger base size and smaller stepping
   from one tile size to the next. In addition to that the default tile size has
   been changed to the second stepping, so that initially both space tiles and
   file/folder tiles have a sufficient size for reading longer names.

* Enhancement - Integrate ToastUI editor in the text editor app: [#10390](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10390)

   We've integrated the ToastUI editor in our text editor app. This makes writing
   markdown much easier, since the users will have access to a markdown compatible
   toolbar. Code syntax highlighting is also supported.

* Enhancement - Custom component extension type: [#10443](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10443)

   We've introduced a new extension type `customComponent`. This allows to register
   a custom component via an extension which can then be rendered in a custom
   component render target. For the mapping to the render target, an extension
   point needs to be registered and a CustomComponentTarget for this extension
   point needs to be in place in a vue template.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10443

* Enhancement - Epub reader app: [#10448](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10448)

   We've added a epub reader app to open ebooks in web. This includes a variety of
   functionalities such as a comprehensive chapter list, font size adjustment
   options, and the ability to remember the user's last reading position even after
   the app is closed.

* Enhancement - Show locked and processing next to other status indicators: [#10544](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10544)

   We've moved the processing and lock indicators to the status table column so all
   indicators are easy accessible at the same spot. We also show the respective
   lock and processing states in the tiles view.

* Enhancement - Set emoji as space icon: [#10546](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10546)

   We've added a new feature to set emojis as space icon, to do so, the user needs
   to click on the 'Set icon' button in the context menu of the respective space
   and has to select an emoji from the emoji picker.

* Enhancement - Add SSE events for locking, renaming, deleting, and restoring: [#10586](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10586)

   We've added Server-Sent Events (SSE) for locking, renaming, deleting, and
   restoring actions. This enhancement ensures that these actions are instantly
   propagated to other browsers and devices where the logged in user has access the
   relevant files and folders. Now, users can experience real-time updates across
   all their devices.

* Enhancement - Remember left nav bar state: [#10611](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10611)

   We've implemented a feature to remember the state of the left navbar. Now, when
   the user reopens the web application, the navbar will remain in its last state,
   either fully open or collapsed, based on the user's previous interaction with
   it.

* Enhancement - Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for File Creation: [#10709](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10709)

   We've implemented Server-Sent Events (SSE) to notify users in real-time when a
   file is uploaded, a new folder is created, or a file is created (e.g., a text
   file). With this enhancement, users will see new files automatically appear in
   another browser tab if they have one open or when collaborating with others in
   the same space.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9782
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10709

* Enhancement - Search providers extension point: [#10758](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10758)

   We've added a new extension point with the id `app.search.provider` and for the
   extensionType `search` that can be used to register additional search providers.
   All search providers that are registered for this extension point will be used
   by the global search automatically.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10758

* Enhancement - Implement Server-Sent Events (SSE) for file updates: [#10782](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10782)

* Enhancement - Display hidden resources information in files list: [#10907](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10907)

   We've added the ability for the user to see how many files and folders are
   hidden in the files list footer.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9036
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10907

* Enhancement - Add loading spinner to admin settings spaces and groups: [#10929](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10929)

   We've added a loading spinner to the spaces and groups view in the admin
   settings to indicate loading task, when the server needs time to respond.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/10922
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10929

* Enhancement - Audio metadata panel: [#10956](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10956)

   We've added a right sidebar panel with the name `Audio Info`, which display
   `audio` metadata if present on the given resource. It is registered by the files
   app and becomes visible in the global right sidebar in all file contexts, e.g.
   file listing with single select on an audio file with indexed id3 information or
   when listening to an audio file in the preview app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10956

* Enhancement - EXIF metadata panel: [#10956](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10956)

   We've added a right sidebar panel with the name `Image Info`, which displays
   `image`, `photo` and `location` metadata if present on the given resource. It is
   registered by the files app and becomes visible in the global right sidebar in
   all file contexts, e.g. file listing with single select on an image or the
   preview app displaying an image.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10956

* Enhancement - Faster page loading times: [#10976](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10976)

   We've massively decreased the initial page loading times. This is especially
   noticeable with slower network connections.

   According to the lighthouse performance metrics, we improved from a score of 60
   to 94 out of 100.

   This has been achieved by taking several different actions:

   - Lazy load large dependencies - Improve chunking - Enable server side
   compression - Reduce the size of the main font we're using - Only register
   translations for the currently selected language

* Enhancement - Add include disabled filter to spaces overview: [#11004](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/11004)

   We've added an 'include disabled' filter to the spaces overview which is off by
   default. This helps the user to manage spaces efficiently, even if there are a
   lot of disabled spaces.

* Enhancement - Multiple sidebar root panels: [#11037](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/11037)

   The right sidebar now supports rendering multiple root panels. Since all panels
   determine their visibility individually it can happen that e.g. for a given file
   type multiple root panels would be available. Previously we only rendered the
   first one. Now we render all of them below each other, separated by a fine
   horizontal line.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/10514

* Change - Theme handling: [#2404](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2404)

   The handling of themes has been throughoutly reworked. Themes now feature a
   human-readable title, can specify whether they are suitable as light or dark
   mode themes. If only one theme is provided, this theme will be set. If two
   themes are provided and one is a dark and one is a light mode one, there is a
   light/dark mode switch button in the AppBar. If more than two themes are
   provided or the two provided themes are not a dark and a light mode one
   respectively, the UI features a theme-switch button featuring a dropdown of the
   human-readable names of the available themes

* Change - Remove deprecated code: [#7338](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7338)

   We have removed the `getToken` getter from our vuex store and support for the
   deprecated `user-management` name for the `admin-settings` app. See linked
   "Deprecations" issue for more information.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7338
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9959

* Change - Keyword Query Language (KQL) search syntax: [#9653](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9653)

   We've introduced
   [KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference)
   as our default query language. Previously we used our own simple language for
   queries which is now replaced by kql.

   `sample.tx* Tags:important Tags:report Content:annual*`

   Becomes

   `name:"sample.tx*" AND tag:important AND tag:report AND content:"annual*"`

   By default KQL uses `AND` as property restriction and the query described above
   can also be formulated as follows

   `name:"sample.tx*" tag:important tag:report content:"annual*"`

   More advanced syntax like grouping combined with boolean property restriction is
   supported too

   `(name:"sample*" name:"*txt") tag:important OR tag:report content:"annual*"`

   BREAKING CHANGE for developers: the term which will be passed to the `search`
   method of search providers is now wrapped inside `name:"..."`. If you don't want
   that behaviour you need to strip it out, e.g. via simple regex: `const rawTerm =
   term.match(new RegExp('name:"\\*(.*?)\\*"'))`.

* Change - DavProperties without namespace: [#9709](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9709)

   The `DavProperties` coming from the `web-client` package don't include their
   namespace anymore. E.g. `{http://owncloud.org/ns}fileid` has now become
   `fileid`. This change was part of moving away from the WebDAV implementation of
   the ownCloudSDK in favor of a new implementation in `web-client`.

   There is a new subset `DavProperties.DavNamespace` to identify all properties
   living under the default namespace `{DAV:}`. All other properties live under the
   owncloud namespace `{http://owncloud.org/ns}`.

* Enhancement - Application unification: [#9302](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9302)

   The existing apps have been refactored and their common functionality has been
   extracted. This enables developers to more easily create custom apps, and brings
   unified behavior like auto-saving, shortcut handling and success/error messages
   across all file viewer/editor apps.

* Enhancement - Don't display confirmation dialog on file deletion: [#9527](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9527)

   We've removed the confirmation dialog while deletion files or folder to enhance
   the user experience. We also show success notifications after the operation.

   This doesn't have impact on the trash bin, confirmation dialog will still be
   displayed there.

* Enhancement - Personal shares can be shown and hidden: [#9531](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9531)

   On the shared-with-me page, there is no distinction between pending, accepted
   and rejected shares anymore. Instead, the user can toggle to display either
   shown or hidden shares.

   Furthermore, accepting and rejecting shares has been renamed to "enable
   sync"/"disable sync" to better reflect what's happening on the server and on
   other devices.

* Enhancement - Indicate processing state: [#9561](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9561)

   If a file has been just recently uploaded, it might go trough a processing state
   (e.G virus scan). If so, no actions on this resource is possible, therefore we
   show now the processing state and make the temporary restrictions clear to the
   user.

   against those. Additionally we added a show/hide toggle button to password input
   field

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9691

* Enhancement - Added app banner for mobile devices: [#9696](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9696)

   We've added an app banner at the top of the web view for mobile devices asking
   the user whether they want to continue working in the app. By dismissing it, it
   will not show again until a new session is started, e.g. by opening a new tab.

* Enhancement - New WebDAV implementation in web-client: [#9709](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9709)

   The WebDAV implementation of the ownCloudSDK has been deprecated in favor of a
   new implementation in the `web-client` package. For developers this means that
   every WebDAV request should be made using the WebDAV factory provided by the
   `ClientService`. E.g. to retrieve files: `const files = await
   clientService.webdav.listFiles(space)`.

   in the context of selecting or sharing resources.

   Please see our documentation for more information and a guide on how to set it
   up.

   Search providers can now be registered as an extension via our extension
   registry. They need to be of type `search`.

   The old way of registering and requesting search providers via the event bus has
   been removed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9794

* Enhancement - Preview image presentation: [#9806](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9806)

   We've updated the preview app to have a more user friendly image browsing

* Enhancement - Registering nav items as extension: [#9814](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9814)

   Nav items can now be registered with the new extension type
   `SidebarNavExtension`, which consists of a `AppNavigationItem` and optionally
   `scopes` (a list of app IDs where the nav item should show).

   Also, 2 new optional properties have been added to the `AppNavigationItem`
   interface:

   `handler` - a click handler that get executes on click. It takes priority over a
   given route. `priority` - a number that determines the nav item's position.

   portals allows developers to add new content below the app container. The name
   of the portal is `app.runtime.footer`.

* Enhancement - Search query term linking: [#9854](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9854)

   We've added the option to search for multiple terms with the same type, at the
   moment only the tag search benefits from it.

   This makes it possible to search for multiple resources with different tags in
   one query. The UI now empowers the user to perform advanced searches like:

   * all resources with the tags `tag1` OR `tag2` * all resources with the tags
   `tag1` OR `tag2` AND containing text `content`

   As a rule of thumb, if a property appears multiple times (like `tag1` OR `tag2`)
   the search combines the query with an `OR` and different keys are linked with an
   `AND`.

* Enhancement - Add permission to delete link passwords when password is enforced: [#9857](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9857)

* Bugfix - Limit amount of concurrent tus requests: [#8987](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8987)

* Bugfix - Prevent "virtual" spaces from being displayed in the UI: [#9015](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9015)

   While ownCloud Web is capable of displaying any type of spaces we found out that
   it is not valid to display so called "virtual" spaces. In such a case users now
   get redirected to their default location (personal space for users, project
   spaces overview for guests).

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/9015

* Bugfix - Sidebar for spaces on "Shared via link"-page: [#9020](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/9020)

* Change - Configurable extension autosave: [#8455](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8455)

   We have added a global setting in the configuration to enable autosave (and the
   corresponding timeout) for bundled and external extensions, instead of having a
   per-extension configuration which was limited to external extensions. Handling
   of the provided autosave needs to be taken care of by the extension itself.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8474

* Change - Theme colors: [#8563](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8563)

   We've introduced `contrast` color variables for all the color swatches in the
   design system. As a result the `contrast` color variable needs to be added to
   all existing web themes.

   BREAKING CHANGE for non-default themes in existing deployments: You need to add
   the `contrast` color variable to all swatches in your theme. A good default is
   the `color-text-inverse` value. You can find an example here:
   https://owncloud.dev/clients/web/theming/#example-theme

* Enhancement - Warn users when using unsupported browsers: [#7942](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7942)

   We've added a warning message if the browser is older than our supported
   configuration, instead of just failing and showing blue/white screens or generic
   errors. Users still have the option to proceed and open the page if they want
   to. By proceeding to the page, the setting is set for 30 days, afterwards the
   warning is shown again.

   When building web, it's possible to pass a documentation url for users to know
   more about this issue, by setting the env variable DOCUMENTATION_URL.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7942

* Enhancement - Optional Contributor role and configurable resharing permissions: [#7965](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7965)

   We've added 2 new capabilities that modify the sharing Roles: -
   `files_sharing.resharing_default` (default true): wether the resharing bit
   should be added to the normal roles (viewer, editor, etc) by default when
   re-sharing is enabled systemwise. If default is set false, users can still set
   resharing in the custom permissions role. -
   `files_sharing.public.can_contribute` (default true): enables or disables the
   Contributor role for public links

   the dialog now tells the difference between files and folders * The
   "Skip"-dialog now tells the difference between files and folders

   can be dynamically resized on screens bigger than mobile, using the "display
   customization options" dropdown.

* Enhancement - Don't open sidebar when copying quicklink: [#8008](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/8008)

   Following user feedback, we don't open the sharing sidebar anymore after
   copying/creating a quicklink.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/8008
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8036

* Enhancement - Access right sidebar panels via URL: [#8021](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8021)

   Opening the right sidebar (including its panels) is now possible via URL param.

   For private or internal links it only requires the new `details` param in the
   URL. For other URLs (e.g. personal space, project space) the `scrollTo` param
   including the resource id is needed as well.

   The following values can be used for the `details` param:

   * `details` - sidebar open, no specific panel * `actions` - actions panel *
   `sharing` - share panel * `versions` - versions panel * `space-share` - members
   panel (project space only)

* Enhancement - Retry failed uploads on re-upload: [#8055](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8055)

   When re-uploading a file that failed uploading before, the upload is now being
   retried instead of being started from scratch again. This fixes some issues with
   the overlay and preserves the upload progress.

   available) with a fallback and only offer copy-to-clipboard buttons if the
   browser supports it.

   space group permissions to child resources * Groups appear in the autocomplete
   list when inviting space members * Selected groups appear in to be invited list
   * Selected groups are part of the share creation request payload * All group
   type members of a space are listed in the members section of the space * All
   users / groups with the "listGrants" permission can see groups which are invited
   to a space * All users / groups who only have access on a share level inside a
   sub-resource of a space can not see all groups which are regular members of the
   space

* Enhancement - Rename "user management" app: [#8175](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8175)

   The "user management" app has been renamed to "admin settings" because the app
   will contain a variety of general settings in the future.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8175

* Enhancement - Spaces list in admin settings: [#8178](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8178)

* Bugfix - Add language param opening external app: [#7419](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7419)

   We've added the language param when opening an external app

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7419
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7631

* Bugfix - Resolve upload existing folder: [#7504](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7504)

   We've added a conflict dialog which handles name clashes when uploading files
   and folders.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6996
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7504

* Bugfix - Shares loading: [#7506](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7506)

   We've improved the loading of shares:

   * Share loading now happens more globally in the sidebar component instead of in
   each sidebar panel. * Shares won't be loaded for resources without a path
   anymore, which massively increases performance. * Several issues with (re-)share
   permissions have been fixed. * `loadCurrentFileOutgoingShares` and
   `loadIncomingShares` mutations have been removed. Instead, incoming and outgoing
   shares are now being loaded via `loadSharesTree()`. This avoids `getShare()`
   requests from being executed multiple times. * Space member loading has been
   decoupled from shares loading in store. This reduces fetching of space members
   to a minimum and improves the structure of the code. * Reactive loading of share
   indicators in sidebar details panel has been fixed. * Reactive loading of space
   member count in the spaces overview has been fixed. * Loading of indirect shares
   within spaces has been fixed.

* Bugfix - Hide search bar in public link context: [#7603](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7603)

   The search bar in a public link context has been hidden because it requires
   authentication.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7603
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7849

* Bugfix - Upload modify time: [#7630](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7630)

   We've included the `x-oc-mtime` header in upload requests to tell the backend
   the proper modify date of uploaded resources.

* Bugfix - Disable copy/move overwrite on self: [#7652](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7652)

   We've disabled copy/move if the file is moved/copied in the exact same location
   as before and the user selects overwrite. Previously this caused an network
   error.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6892
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7652

* Bugfix - Inhibit move files between spaces: [#7652](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7652)

   parent share's permissions in certain scenarios.

* Bugfix - Remove the "close sidebar"-calls on delete: [#7699](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7699)

   We've removed the "close sidebar"-calls when deleting a resource as the
   mutations are not available as well as not needed anymore.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7699
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7733

* Bugfix - Folder conflict dialog: [#7724](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7724)

   after changing it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7734

* Bugfix - Disable shares loading on public and trash locations: [#7739](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7739)

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7739

   "Create quicklink"-action.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7736
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7740

* Bugfix - Reload file list after last share removal: [#7748](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7748)

   We've fixed a bug where the file list would not update after removing the last
   share or link. Also, we now prevent the shares tree from being loaded again if
   the removed share was not the last one.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7748

* Bugfix - Try to obtain refresh token before the error case: [#7756](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7756)

   We've added a fallback strategy to try to revive the refresh token one more last
   time. This is for the rare case where the application is running in the
   background and the browsers throttles the token refresh mechanism.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7756

* Bugfix - Hide actions in space trash bins: [#7768](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7768)

   We've fixed a bug where routing into re-shares and their parent folders from the
   "Shared with others/via link" page was broken.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7790

   showing the right content.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7778
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7787

* Bugfix - Sidebar without highlighted resource: [#7781](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7781)

   Sidebar panels that require a resource now won't be loaded without such. This
   fixes a bug where navigating with an open sidebar would break it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7781
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7826

* Bugfix - Do not load files from cache in public links: [#7811](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7811)

   When apps (i.e Drawio) try to load a file, the browser caches the request. If
   the file was modified somewhere else, this causes inconsistent results which
   prevent saving any changes until the cache is properly cleared. This had
   previously been fixed for normal files, but not yet for public links - which we
   took care of now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7811
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7075

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7830

* Bugfix - Handle non 2xx external app responses: [#7861](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7861)

   Axios no longer skips on non 200 status responses in app-external. If the status
   is not 2xx, the application now displays a proper error message.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7861

* Bugfix - Share editing after selecting a space: [#7873](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7873)

   We've fixed a bug where editing or deleting shares in the personal space was not
   possible if a project space was selected previously.

* Bugfix - "Keep both"-conflict option: [#7903](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7903)

   We've fixed an issue with the "Keep both"-conflict option where uploaded folders
   would get mixed up.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7905

* Bugfix - Prefer alias links over private links: [#7916](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7916)

   The private link capability has recently been enabled in oCIS to announce to
   clients that private links are available. However, if alias links are available
   the web ui is supposed to only show alias links. Thus the "copy private link"
   button has been disabled when alias links are available.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7916

* Bugfix - Editing text files on public pages: [#7936](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7936)

   We've fixed a bug where editing text files on public pages was not possible with
   the oC10 backend.

   me"-page has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8009

* Bugfix - Introduce "upload finalizing"-state in upload overlay: [#7956](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7956)

   The "upload finalizing"-state has been introduced to the upload overlay. This
   state is relevant during the time window when all data has been transferred to
   the server (= progress bar is at 100%), but the server still needs to write all
   data to the storage.

   The "cancel"- and "pause"-actions are disabled during the "upload
   finalizing"-state as the data transfer is technically finished. Previously, when
   pausing and resuming when being in this state, the upload would be marked as
   successful instantly, despite the server still writing to the storage.

* Bugfix - Prevent file upload when folder creation failed: [#7975](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7975)

   We've fixed a bug where files would try to be uploaded if the creation of their
   respective folder failed beforehand.

* Bugfix - Prevent retrying uploads with status code 5xx: [#7985](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7985)

   Uploads with status code 5xx can't be retried on the server side, hence the
   automatic retry has been disabled in such cases.

   changed has been fixed.

   We've fixed a bug where the password form on a public drop page would not show
   after setting a required password.

* Bugfix - Prevent unnecessary request when saving a user: [#8011](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/8011)

   We've fixed a bug where changing the role of a user without changing any other
   data would cause an unnecessary request.

* Bugfix - Saving a file multiple times with the text editor: [#8030](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8030)

   An issue with saving a file multiple times via text editor has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/8030

* Change - Drive aliases in URLs: [#6648](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6648)

   We changed the URL format to not use storageIds in the URL path anymore to
   identify spaces, but instead use drive aliases of spaces in the URL path.

   BREAKING CHANGE for users: this breaks existing bookmarks - they won't resolve
   anymore. BREAKING CHANGE for developers: the appDefaults composables from
   web-pkg now work with drive aliases, concatenated with relative item paths,
   instead of webdav paths. If you use the appDefaults composables in your
   application it's likely that your code needs to be adapted.

* Change - Remove mediaSource and v-image-source: [#7935](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7935)

   We have removed the deprecated `mediaSource` helper function and the
   `v-image-source` directive.

   BREAKING CHANGE for developers: `mediaSource` and `v-image-source` are not
   available anymore, `loadPreview` should be used once web-pkg is published.

* Enhancement - Add `X-Request-ID` header to all outgoing requests: [#4675](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4675)

   `X-Request-ID` headers have been added to all outgoing requests to make the
   tracing of requests easier.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4675
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7800

* Enhancement - Id based routing: [#6247](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6247)

   We now include fileIds in the URL query to be able to - resolve files and spaces
   correctly and - resolve the correct relative path of a file if it was changed
   (this might be the case for bookmarks) The fileIds in the URL can be disabled by
   setting `options.routing.idBased` to `false` in the `config.json`.

   Note: It's recommended to keep the default of fileIds being used in routing.
   Otherwise it's not possible to resolve spaces with name clashes correctly.

* Enhancement - Deny subfolders inside share: [#7190](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7190)

   Sub-folders within user- and group-shares can now be denied for certain share
   receivers if the backend is capable of negative ACLs. Please note that the state
   of this feature is experimental and needs to be enabled in the backend.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7180
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7190

* Enhancement - Auth context in route meta props: [#7234](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7234)

   The route meta prop has been extended by a new "meta.authContext" property (can
   be one out of "anonymous", "user", "publicLink" or "hybrid"). With this, app
   developers can now define anonymous routes, which was hardcoded to a few well
   known route names before. Anonymous routes are rendered in the application
   layout, i.e. with the top bar, as the ownCloud Web Chrome should always be
   visible to the user (except for a few handpicked exceptions in the web runtime,
   which are still rendered in the plain layout).

* Enhancement - Webdav support in web-client package: [#7430](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7430)

   Only relevant for developers: We've added webdav support to the `web-client`
   package. This wraps the existing webdav requests from ownCloud SDK but handles
   the differentiation of public link and user-specific webdav requests internally.

   receivers.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7890

* Enhancement - Respect the new sharing denials capability (experimental): [#7892](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7892)

   The oCIS backend has added a new capability, files_sharing.enable_denials, which
   announces to clients if the experimental "No access" sharing role is supposed to
   be available. This capability is now respected by web, so that users only see
   the experimental "No access" role if the backend allows it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7892

* Bugfix - Don't leak oidc callback url into browser history: [#3071](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3071)

   We've made sure that the oidc callback url does not appear in the browser
   history after the user has been redirected back from the IdP to ownCloud Web.

* Bugfix - Logout deleted user on page reload: [#4677](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4677)

   A user that gets disabled or deleted in the backend now sees an authentication
   error page upon page reload. From there they can now properly reach the login
   page to log in again via a different user (or leave the page entirely).

   for accessing the shares panel through the sharing information.

* Bugfix - Access token renewal: [#7030](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7030)

   Access token renewals had some flaws which have been fixed as follows: - OAuth2:
   access token renewal was not working at all, fixed by switching to authorization
   code flow with PKCE extension and by migrating from the unmaintained
   `oidc-client` library to `oidc-client-ts`. - OpenID Connect: when
   `offline_access` scope was not requested each token renewal caused a redirect to
   `/`, which was due to a faulty token update implementation and is fixed.

   WARNING: With a setup of ownCloud 10.x.x + oauth2-app older than v0.5.3 this
   bugfix is a breaking change. There was a bug in the oauth2-app that required to
   add the `clientSecret` in the `auth` section of the `config.json` file (although
   code flow with PKCE doesn't need it). To mitigate this, please add the
   `clientSecret` for your `clientId` to the `config.json` file. If the oauth2-app
   v0.5.3 or newer is used that's not needed.

* Bugfix - File list render performance: [#7038](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7038)

   We've drastically increased the initial render performance of the files list by
   removing the lazy loading delay and by moving the loading visualization from the
   OcTd to the OcTr component. For the selection of files there also has been a
   slight improvement in render speed.

   / user context is blocking the boot process of applications after a [recent
   PR](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7072) has been merged, we are now able
   to reliably print the backend version on the first page load after login as well
   (was not possible before).

   details if an upload to a share fails because the share owner's quota is
   exceeded.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7174

* Enhancement - Loading context blocks application bootstrap: [#7030](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7030)

   The bootstrap architecture has been improved to ensure that the respective
   context (user or public link) is fully resolved before applications can finalize
   their boot process and switch over to rendering their content. This means that
   application developers can rely on user data / public link data being loaded
   (including e.g. capabilities) when the web runtime triggers the boot processes
   and rendering of applications.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7030
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7072

* Enhancement - Resolve bookmarked public links with password protection: [#7030](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7030)

   Bookmarks to a public link (e.g. when user navigated into a subfolder and then
   created a bookmark) or to an app that was opened from a public link (e.g. photo
   opened in preview app) now properly resolve the public link context before
   loading the bookmarked content. This includes a roundtrip to the password input
   prompt for password protected public link, e.g. when a password was set in the
   first place, has been changed in the meantime, etc.

* Enhancement - Reduce pagination options: [#7038](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/7038)

   We've reduced the pagination options by removing the options to display 1000 and
   all files. These may be added again later after further improving the files
   table performance.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7188

* Enhancement - Re-sharing for ocis: [#7086](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7086)

   We've enhanced web to be able to re-share resources when using an ownCloud
   infinite scale backend. It now works for project and personal spaces as well as
   the sharing jail. Besides that we also send roles, space-ref and path as
   separate values to the sharing api which simplifies the usage of it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7139

* Enhancement - Add Keyboard navigation/selection: [#7153](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7153)

   We've added the possibility to navigate and select via keyboard. - Navigation: -
   via keyboard arrows up/down for moving up and down through the rows of the file
   list - Selection - via keyboard space bar: select / deselect the currently
   highlighted row - via keyboard shift + arrows up/down: add a series of rows -
   via keyboard cmd/ctrl + a: select all rows - via keyboard esc: deselect all rows
   - via mouse holding cmd/ctrl + left click on a row: add/remove the clicked item
   to/from the current selection model - via mouse holding shift + left click on a
   row: add the clicked row and the series of rows towards the most recently
   clicked row to the current selection model.

* Enhancement - Don't open right sidebar from private links: [#7559](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7559)

   We've changed the behaviour of the web ui to not open the right sidebar anymore
   when the URL contains a "scrollTo" option. We still select the file and scroll
   it into the view, but opening the right sidebar felt very invasive, so we now
   leave that choice to the user.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7559

* Enhancement - Adjust spacing of the files list options menu: [#7570](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7570)

* Enhancement - Simplify mime type checking: [#7605](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7605)

   We've removed the dependency to GuzzleHttp from our oc10 app package. It was
   used for mime type checking only. Instead we now rely on a mime type checker
   that is already bundled with oc10 core. IMPORTANT: this enhancement is needed to
   reach compatibility with oc10.11 and maintain backwards compatibility with oc
   prior to oc10.11. This would not be easily doable when still relying on
   GuzzleHttp because its major version was updated from 5 to 7 in oc10.11.

* Enhancement - Separate direct and indirect link shares in sidebar: [#7140](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7140)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Folder link targets: [#7156](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7156)

   Some views were missing parameters of their default target locations, e.g. the
   Favorites view and the search result page didn't link to the correct folders
   anymore. This has been fixed by always setting the personal view with the id of
   the current user as default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7156

* Enhancement - Separate direct and indirect link shares in sidebar: [#7140](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7140)

   We have split the list of link shares into two lists, one with direct (and
   editable) and another one with read-only indirect link shares of parent folders
   for better structure in the sidebar.

* Bugfix - Share downloads: [#3760](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/3760)

   Both single file and folder shares didn't have the download action available on
   the `Shared with me` page. We've fixed this by allowing the shared with me route
   for download actions and by fixing a download permission check on shares.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/3760
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6936

* Bugfix - Share hint with disabled federated sharing: [#5261](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5261)

   We've removed any occurrences of federated sharing in the hint below the sharing
   input field if federated sharing is disabled.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5261
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6951

* Bugfix - Password enforcement for public links: [#6323](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6323)

   Password enforcement for public links, which can be adjusted on a per-role
   basis, wasn't properly reflected in the UI. We have made the necessary
   adjustments to only enforce passwords for public links with the permissions that
   require a password according to the backend settings.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6323
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6749

* Bugfix - Do not load files from cache: [#6447](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6447)

   When apps (i.e Drawio) tried to load a file, the browser caches the request. If
   the file was modified somewhere else and the browser reads the file and its
   version from the cache, the content shown to the user is outdated and saving any
   changes is impossible until the cache is properly cleared. Thus we now ask the
   browser to never load files from its cache in apps.

   In order to achieve that we send a `Cache-Control` header along with requests.
   Unfortunately currently released ownCloud 10 versions do not accept that header
   in cross site origin setups. If you run ownCloud Web on a different domain than
   your ownCloud 10 instance, then you might need to add `Cache-Control` to the
   list of allowed CORS headers:

   `occ config:system:set cors.allowed-headers --type json --value
   '["cache-control"]'`

   Please make sure you don't override previous values!

* Bugfix - Resetting store on logout: [#6694](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6694)

   When logging out, only some parts of vuex store were reset to default. This
   caused bugs by switching to another account that has some other/missing
   settings. For example, if the account has no quota, the quota of the previously
   logged in account was shown. We have fixed this by resetting the user store
   module on logout with reset function (vuex extensions library) and creating an
   action to reset dynamic nav items.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6694

* Bugfix - Apply text selection range for new files: [#6756](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6756)

   We've fixed a bug, where the text selection range for a new file has not been
   applied only for the file name but also for the file extension. This is now
   working as in the rename modal and just selects the text for the file name.

   We've fixed a bug, where renaming a file in the favorites file list to a file
   with the same name but located in a different folder was not possible, as the
   message `The name "..." is already taken` appeared.

   We've fixed a bug, where the ETag instead of OC-ETag in the text editor app was
   used, due to server encoding, the ETag might be manipulated and contain the gzip
   suffix on a large text file. Saving the respective file, might cause an error,
   as the sent ETag doesn't match the server's ETag.

   instead of failing directly.

   only one role is available for sharing.

   both not being shown. This has been fixed by making the URL construction more
   reliable regarding different ID formats.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7108

* Enhancement - Log correct oCIS version if available: [#3805](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/pull/3805)

   OCIS has introduced a new `productversion` field to announce it's correct
   version while maintaining a fake 10.x.x version in the `versionstring` field to
   keep clients compatible. We're using the new productversion field when it exists
   and use versionstring as a fallback. Thus the backend product information prints
   the correct oCIS version now.

   function with String.prototype.slice() which works similarly but isn't
   deprecated.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6718

* Enhancement - Redesign link sharing: [#6749](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6749)

   We have redesigned the public link list in the right sidebar. Links now can be
   edited in-line and have a similiar look-and-feel to people and group shares.
   Additionally, creating new links now is less cumbersome and the default name,
   while not configurable from the backend anymore, is now translated.

   their personal space id.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7053

* Enhancement - Use tus chunksize from backend: [#7120](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/7120)

   We now use the chunksize value coming from the backend for uploading via tus. If
   no chunksize is given, it will default to `Infinity`. The Web config
   `uploadChunkSize` has been removed as a result.

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Use oC10 navigation entry names: [#6656](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6656)

   When fetching navigation entries from oC10, we previously used the app's names.
   This caused issues when the navigation entry ID and the app ID differ. Also, the
   navigation entries did not match with the ones in the classic UI. This has been
   fixed as we now use the navigation entry name, which falls back to the app name
   if not given.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6585
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6656

* Bugfix - AppBar ViewOptions alignment: [#6662](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6662)

   We have fixed a visual glitch that rendered the ViewOptions in the AppBar on the
   left side instead of right-aligned if no Breadcrumbs or SharesNavigation is
   present.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6685
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6662

* Bugfix - Accessible breadcrumb itemcount: [#6690](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6690)

   Our breadcrumbs announce the amount of resources inside a folder. Due to a bug
   the calculated number wasn't announced correctly, which we have resolved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6022
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6690

* Bugfix - Hide sidebar toggle button on spaces projects page: [#6690](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6690)

   We have hidden the sidebar toggle button on the spaces projects page to avoid
   user confusion.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6690

* Bugfix - TopBar on redirect: [#6704](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6704)

   We fixed a visual glitch that showed the topbar on redirect pages.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6527
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6704

* Bugfix - Unsticky appbar position: [#6708](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6708)

   After recent changes to the files appbar, it wouldn't be visible when scrolling
   inside the table. This has been resolved.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6696
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6708

* Enhancement - Remove public links from SharedWithOthers page: [#5976](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5976)

   We've removed links from the shared-with-others page as those belong in the
   `Shared via link` page (and already exist there).

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5976
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6612

* Enhancement - Add "Shared with" column for "Shared with me" page: [#6140](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6140)

   We've added the "Shared with" column for incoming shares in the "Shared with me"
   page and changed the order of the column to follow the "Share owner" column.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6140
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6699

* Enhancement - Archive download for oc10 backend: [#6239](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6239)

   We now offer archive downloads (multifile or folder) as archive with oc10
   backends. Since oc10 archive downloads are path based this could only be made
   possible on pages that follow the folder hierarchy of the logged in user. In
   other words: on favorites pages the archive download is unavailable for oc10
   backends as the selected files/folders don't necessarily share the same parent
   folder.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6239
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6697

* Enhancement - Audio support in preview app: [#6514](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6514)

   We've added support for audio file playback into the preview app (namely flac,
   mp3, wav and ogg).

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6514

* Enhancement - Audio handling in preview app: [#6514](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6514)

   We've built audio preview support for flac, mp3, ogg and wav files into the
   preview app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6514

* Enhancement - Rename mediaviewer to preview: [#6514](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6514)

   We've renamed the media-viewer app to preview because that describes the purpose
   of the app better and doesn't mislead users into thinking that it's a full blown
   media viewer.

   For the time being we've added an app alias handling to ownCloud Web which
   prints a deprecation warning if the preview app is tried to be loaded as
   `media-viewer`.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6514

* Enhancement - Editor role for single file public links: [#6618](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6618)

   Allow creating a public link with editor role for a single file. Only available
   in oCIS.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6618

* Enhancement - Make some UI elements/actions optional: [#6618](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6618)

   Make renaming a share, permanently deleting files and showing the custom
   permissions role optional via capabilities. By default, all of these options are
   enabled/showed.

   Capabilities: * capabilities.files_sharing.can_rename *
   capabilities.files.permanent_deletion * capabilities.files_sharing.allow_custom

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6324
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6618

* Enhancement - Spaces link sharing: [#6633](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6633)

   Spaces and their resources can now be shared via links.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6283
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6633

* Enhancement - Spaces group sharing: [#6639](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6639)

   Resources within a space can now be shared with user groups. Spaces themselves
   can't be shared with groups, therefore those have been removed from the
   autocomplete results when adding members to a space.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6283
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6639

* Enhancement - Spaces overview topbar layout: [#6642](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6642)

   We've adjusted the topbar layout of the spaces overview to match the other
   pages.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6641
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6642

* Enhancement - PDF viewer: [#6654](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6654)

   We've added a lightweight PDF viewer app which allows the user to bookmark PDF
   files.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6654

* Enhancement - Spaces context menus: [#6659](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6659)

   Spaces context menus have been adjusted visibly to match the other available
   context menus. Also, the corresponding component has been abstracted in the
   course of this. This cleans up a lot of (duplicated) code across the spaces
   views and makes future adjustments easier.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6634
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6659

* Enhancement - Space name in breadcrumb: [#6662](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6662)

   We have updated the breadcrumbs to show a space's name (if available).

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6637
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6662

* Enhancement - Text Editor: [#6667](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6667)

   Replace MarkdownEditor with Text Editor and add the following improvements: *
   Disable preview for non md files (configurable) * Data integrity checks (prevent
   exiting with unsaved changes) * Better error information to the user * Keyboard
   shortcut to save * Read-only mode * Fix to open on non-authenticated public
   links * Open other extensions (js, json, xml, py, php, yaml) * UI polish

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6667
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6754
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6763

* Enhancement - Full screen external apps: [#6688](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6688)

   It allows, for example, presentation apps to enter full screen.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6688

* Enhancement - Permission-based visibility of upload and create buttons: [#6690](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6690)

   Instead of showing disabled "Upload" and "New" buttons on public links with
   insufficient permissions, we now hide them for the page visitor.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5618
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6690

* Enhancement - Spaces quota unlimited option: [#6693](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6693)

   Space quota can now be set to unlimited

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6470
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6693

* Enhancement - Unified shares sidebar panel: [#6701](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6701)

   We've merged the "people" and "link" shares sidebar panels to give users a
   clearer idea of who has access to a resource.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6621
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6701

* Enhancement - Update ODS to v13.1.0-rc.2: [#6701](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6701)

   resource name without extension.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6736

* Enhancement - Provide dependencies to applications: [#6746](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6746)

   We reduced the bundle size of externally built applications and the risk of
   clashing library instances by passing certain dependencies into applications
   (namely `@vue/composition-api`, `vuex` and `luxon`).

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Sidebar panels in public links: [#2090](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2090)

   Public links were showing some panels (People, Links, Versions) that were not
   supposed to be visible in public links. We've fixed that by excluding those
   panels on public link routes.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2090
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6567

* Bugfix - Thumbnails only for accepted shares: [#5310](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5310)

   Only accepted shares now display a thumbnail in the "Shared with me" resource
   table.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5310
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6534

* Bugfix - Resolve private links: [#5654](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5654)

   Private links didn't resolve correctly anymore because the internal file path
   handling was changed in our api client (owncloud-sdk). We've adjusted it
   accordingly so that private links now resolve correctly again.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5654

* Bugfix - File handling in apps: [#6456](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6456)

   We fixed loading and saving files in apps in all contexts. It's now possible to
   open files in apps in personal files, favorites, share views and spaces.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6456

* Bugfix - Rename parent folder: [#6516](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6516)

   We fixed the rename option in the parent folder / breadcrumb context menu. It
   was broken due to malformed webdav paths.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6516
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6631

* Bugfix - Prevent cross-site scripting attack while displaying space description: [#6523](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6523)

   We've added a new package that strips out possible XSS attack code while
   displaying the space description

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6526
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6523

* Bugfix - Don't write error message on passing ReadmeContentModal.spec.js test: [#6525](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6525)

   ReadmeContentModal.spec.js test doesn't write error output anymore while passing

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6337
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6525

* Bugfix - Show no auth popup on password protected public links in ownCloud 10: [#6530](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6530)

   We fixed a native browser auth popup erroneously being shown for password
   protected public links with ownCloud 10.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5727
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6530
   https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-sdk/pull/1020

* Bugfix - Natural sort order: [#6532](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6532)

   We've fixed the sort order to respect natural sorting again. Also used the
   chance to make use of `Intl.Collator` instead of `localeCompare` which is
   considered to be a performance improvement.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6532
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6632

* Bugfix - Pressing enter in forms: [#6548](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6548)

   We fixed behavior when pressing enter in forms. For instance when adding or
   editing public links pressing enter in the name or password input fields,
   instead of saving the link it opened the datepicker.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6548
   https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-design-system/pull/2009

* Bugfix - Prevent the member count inside a space from disappearing: [#6550](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6550)

   We've fixed a bug where opening the sidebar for a file inside a space caused the
   member count of the space to disappear.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6550

* Bugfix - Remove iFrame border: [#6555](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6555)

   We fixed a UI issue which showed small borders around iFrames, e.g. in the
   external app.

   because there is no element to observe.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6569

* Enhancement - Resolve private links into folders instead of parent: [#5533](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5533)

   Private links always resolved into the parent folder of the linked file and
   visually highlighted the file or folder from the link. We've changed this
   behaviour to directly navigate into the folder in case the linked resource is a
   folder and only keep the previous behaviour for when the linked resource is a
   file.

* Enhancement - Shares overview: [#6440](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6440)

   We've merged the three shares navigation items into one central "Shares" item,
   with a toggle to switch between the three different kinds of shares (incoming,
   outgoing, links). In the process, we have also renamed the "All files" page to
   the "Personal" page, indicating that this is the user's personal space since
   shares (and potentially other shared spaces) live elsewhere.

   changes within a space do not require the space the be fetched again. This also
   ensures that the space image and readme won't be fetched when navigating into
   subfolders. * The space now gets set at the end of the loading task. This
   ensures that the space task has finished as soon as the image and readme get
   loaded.

   We've moved app context information (where you get redirected when you close an
   app) into the query instead of a regular param. This relocates this information
   further to the back of the url where it's less confusing for users.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6622

* Enhancement - Internet Explorer deprecation warning banner: [#6629](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6629)

Changelog for ownCloud Web [5.1.0] (2022-02-18)
=======================================
The following sections list the changes in ownCloud web 5.1.0 relevant to
ownCloud admins and users.

[5.1.0]: https://github.com/owncloud/web/compare/v5.0.0...v5.1.0

Summary
-------

* Bugfix - App compatibility: [#6439](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6439)

* Enhancement - Enable context menu for search results: [#6445](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6445)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - App compatibility: [#6439](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6439)

   We've made sure that apps that were not made compatible with ownCloud Web 5.0.0
   don't run into a non-rendered state.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6439

   properly back to the original search.

   Using the store for spaces integrates them seamlessly in our ecosystem and makes
   it easier to develop spaces even further. E.g. the properties of a space can now
   be altered without fetching all spaces again. This was achieved by introducing a
   "buildSpace" method, that transforms a space into a more generic resource object
   (just like regular files or shares).

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6427

* Enhancement - Enable context menu for search results: [#6445](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6445)

* Bugfix - Scrolling inside Markdown Editor: [#4606](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4606)

   Scrolling inside the Markdown Editor was broken, before the redesign by allowing
   the user to scroll the appBar out of the viewport, and after the redesign by
   cutting a potentially long preview off at the bottom. This has been addressed by
   allowing to scroll the preview content.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4606
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6386

* Bugfix - Open folder from context menu: [#6187](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6187)

   We fixed a bug in the context menu that prevented correct folder navigation
   ("Open folder").

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6187
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6232

* Bugfix - Focus management in topbar dropdowns: [#6213](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6213)

   We've fixed issues with focus management upon opening and closing the dropdown
   menus in the ApplicationSwitcher and Usermenu.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6213

* Bugfix - Application config not available to application: [#6296](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6296)

   We fixed a bug in providing config to external apps like draw-io.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6296
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6298

* Bugfix - Breadcrumbs in different views: [#6326](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6326)

   The files app had the breadcrumbs broken in the various views. We fixed that by
   actively watching the current route now for updates of some active route
   helpers.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6326
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6370

* Bugfix - Add and remove to/from favorites: [#6328](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6328)

   We've fixed bugs related to adding and removing files to/from favorites: -
   "favorite" star button in the right sidebar of the files app was not being
   updated when the favorite-state was modified through a click on the star icon -
   toggling the favorites state of the current folder was broken (via both context
   menu on current folder and right sidebar without a file selection)

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6328
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6330

* Bugfix - Jumpy batch actions: [#6360](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6360)

   We fixed a bug that made the batch actions move up and down a few pixels every
   time they appeared/disappeared.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6360

* Bugfix - Failed move by drag'n'drop doesn't show the resource name in the error: [#6412](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6412)

   We fixed the error message when moving an item via drag-and-drop failed, now it
   shows the correct name of the item.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6412

* Change - Remove UiKit: [#6103](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6103)

   The ownCloud design system has dropped the underlying UiKit library, which we've
   also removed from the web codebase to reduce the overall bundle size.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6103
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6213

* Change - Use remixicons for redesign: [#6142](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6142)

   We've switched the iconset to remixicons to fit the new design.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6100
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6142
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6270

* Change - Rename theme logo sidebar to topbar: [#6349](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6349)

   With the redesign, the theme-able logo has moved from the sidebar to the topbar.
   Accordingly, within a theme, the key for it has been renamed from `sidebar` to
   `topbar`.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6349
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6386

* Change - Dropped editor route whitelist: [#6381](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6381)

   We've dropped the `routes` key from file extension handlers defined by editor
   apps. This was used as a whitelist for being rendered as available editor in the
   files app. The only usage of this was for disabling editors in the trashbin.
   We've moved that part of the business logic to the files app itself and from now
   on ignore the `routes` key from editors.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6381

* Change - Drop support for Internet Explorer and other dead browsers: [#6386](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6386)

   Even though it was never officially supported, we were still checking for
   certain dead browsers. This has now been dropped.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6386

* Change - Enforce extensions to always display the ui-header: [#6401](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6401)

   We've enforced the ui to always render the header for third party extensions.
   From now on extensions are not able to disable the header anymore.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6401

* Enhancement - File creation via app provider: [#5890](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5890)

   For oCIS deployments the integration of the app provider for editing files was
   enhanced by adding support for the app provider capabilities to create files as
   well.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5890
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6312

* Enhancement - Persist chosen sorting options: [#5930](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5930)

   We now persist the chosen sorting options per view into the local storage of the
   browser. This means, that when e.g. the `All files` page is sorted by last
   modification date and the `Share with others` page is sorted by share receivers,
   the web UI remembers those choices for example across browser tabs or during
   navigation in the folder tree.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5930
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6290

* Enhancement - File selection simplification: [#5967](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5967)

   When creating a file or folder the created item is neither selected nor scrolled
   to anymore. This enhances usability because the selection model doesn't get
   altered to a single item selection anymore and allows to create items and adding
   them to a preselected set of resources. It also fixes an accessibility violation
   as the selection model (and with it the current page in it's entirety) is not
   altered anymore without announcement.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5967
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6208

* Enhancement - Redesign main layout: [#6036](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6036)

   We've started to implement the redesign by adjusting the sidebar, topbar and
   appswitcher. While doing so, we also removed the `vue2-touch-events` dependency.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6386

* Enhancement - Redirect to IDP when opening apps from bookmark: [#6045](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6045)

   We've expanded the check for authentication requirements to the referrer of the
   current URL. As a result an app that doesn't necessarily require authentication
   can still require authentication based on the file context it was opened in.
   This is especially important for situations where an app is opened for a file
   from a bookmark, so that we cannot rely on the user already having an
   authenticated session.

* Enhancement - Redesign appswitcher: [#6102](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6102)

   We've redesigned the appswitcher to follow the new design and highlight the
   currently used app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6102
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6349

* Enhancement - Drawio improvements: [#6125](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6125)

   - Honor the autosave configuration, and actually save - Show error messages to
   the user, currently all failures are silent

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6125

* Enhancement - Add URL handling to markdown editor: [#6134](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6134)

   We made the markdown editor URL aware. This enables the close button to return
   to the source folder of the file being edited and also enables opening the
   editor again on page reload.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5928
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6134

* Enhancement - Reorganize urls: [#6137](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6137)

   With the [global-url-format
   ADR](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/blob/master/docs/ocis/adr/0011-global-url-format.md)
   we've decided how the internal and external URL schema should look like.

   To have a human understandable structure we've decided to also rethink how the
   overall structure should look like. This PR introduces the new schema and takes
   care that existing routes still work by redirecting them.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6137
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/blob/master/docs/ocis/adr/0011-global-url-format.md

* Enhancement - Lazy resource table cells: [#6204](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6204)

   ODS introduced lazy loadable table cells, this feature is now also part of web
   and enabled by default. To disable the feature set the displayResourcesLazy
   option to false.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6204

* Enhancement - Show parent folder for resources: [#6226](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6226)

   We've added a visual hint for the parent folder of a resource in cases where it
   could be usefull.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5953
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6226

* Enhancement - Darkmode theme switcher: [#6242](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6242)

   We've added a theme switcher and now initialize the user interface theme based
   on the user's browser preferences. It also gets saved to the localstorage of the
   browser so the user's preference gets saved locally.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6242

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6254

* Enhancement - Add default sorting to the spaces list: [#6262](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6262)

   Spaces will now be sorted by their name by default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6253
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6262

* Enhancement - Redesigned user menu: [#6272](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6272)

   We've redesigned the user menu. It now also features more detailed information
   about the user's quota and how much space they have left.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6101
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6272

* Enhancement - Implement spaces front page: [#6287](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6287)

   Each space can now be entered from within the spaces list. The space front page
   will then display all the space contents, plus an image and a readme file if
   set. Basic actions like uploading files, creating folders, renaming resources,
   and more. were also implemented in the course of this.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6271
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6287

* Enhancement - Resource-specific icons in ResourceTable: [#6295](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6295)

* Enhancement - Context Route Params: [#6331](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6331)

   We now add params of the source context route to the query of app routes and
   convert them back to params when routing back to the origin - this is necessary
   to properly navigate back from opening files in extensions or in search results,
   throughout personal, public or, in the future, spaces views.

* Enhancement - Print version numbers: [#5954](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5954)

   The package version of the web UI and the version of the backend (if available)
   now get printed to the browser console and get set as meta generator tag in the
   html head. This makes it possible to easily reference versions in bug reports.

[4.8.0]: https://github.com/owncloud/web/compare/v4.7.0...v4.8.0

Summary
-------

* Bugfix - Sort before pagination: [#5687](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5687)
* Bugfix - Editor default handling: [#6186](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6186)
* Enhancement - Edit people shares without changing the panel: [#6039](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6039)

* Enhancement - Respect share max, min and enforced expiration date: [#6176](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6176)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Sort before pagination: [#5687](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5687)

   We've extracted the sorting logic from the [OcTable
   component](https://owncloud.design/#/oC%20Components/OcTable) and moved it to
   the data preprocessing steps in web. This way we won't sort the current page
   anymore, but sort the whole data of the current folder and then only show the
   current page from that sorted data.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5687
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6136

* Bugfix - Editor default handling: [#6186](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6186)

   Editor apps that don't provide the information about whether or not they are a
   default editor were not recognized as default editors when left-clicking a file
   in the file list. We've changed the default behaviour so that editors are
   capable of being the default editor unless explicitly disabled.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6186

* Enhancement - Edit people shares without changing the panel: [#6039](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6039)

   We have reworked the full list view of sharees in the right sidebar for better
   overview and faster editing.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5763
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6039

* Enhancement - Simplify people sharing sidebar: [#6039](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6039)

   We have reworked the people sharing sidebar to not be split into
   show/edit/create panels. The create form now is fixed to the top with the
   sharees list below and editing happening in-line.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5923
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5608
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5797
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6039

* Enhancement - Respect share max, min and enforced expiration date: [#6176](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6176)

   If the expiration date max and/or enforcement is supported (defined by the
   capabilities) the UI now handles the different cases and respects the backend
   settings. In oc10 there are options to enforce the maximum available date for
   group and user shares, this is now considered in the UI and updates dynamically
   in both cases.

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Double escaping in progress bar: [#4214](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4214)

   We fixed file names with special chars not being properly displayed in the
   upload progressbar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4214
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6131

* Bugfix - Open in browser for public files: [#4615](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4615)

   We fixed opening publicly shared files in the browser.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4615
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6133

* Bugfix - File renaming: [#4893](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4893)

   We fixed the displayed file name not being properly updated in files list and
   sidebar after renaming.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4893
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6114

* Bugfix - Context for dates in SideBar: [#5068](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5068)

   We fixed dates in sidebar file info having no context. The sidebar is either
   showing the last modification date or the deletion date. Before this change it
   wasn't obvious what kind of date was showing. Especially when the file list was
   showing a completely different date (e.g., a share date) it was confusing to the
   user to see a possibly different date here without explanation.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5068
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6119

* Bugfix - Extension casing: [#5339](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5339)

   We fixed file extensions always being shown in lowercase.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5339
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6117

* Bugfix - Do not scroll on apps open in app provider: [#5960](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5960)

   Apps opened from the app provider were taking more than the window size,
   prompting the use of the scrollbar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5960
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6003

* Bugfix - Show extension image: [#5985](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985)

   Allow extensions to set an image as its logo, instead of an icon. If `img` is
   set, it will take precedence over `icon`.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985

* Bugfix - Hidden files hidden by default: [#5985](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985)

   Hide hidden files (files started with ".") by default, similar to oc10

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985

* Bugfix - Order extensions and default: [#5985](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985)

   Ensure the default extensions are displayed first. Ensure that extensions can be
   set as default or not.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985

* Bugfix - Show context menu for all file extensions: [#6002](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6002)

   The context menu was failing to build for file extensions that did not have a
   match in the apps from the app provider.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6002
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6003

* Bugfix - Inconsistencies in share expiry dates: [#6084](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6084)

   * Share expiry dates now always refer to the end of the given day. This change
   allows users to select the current day as expiry date. * Displayed expiry dates
   have been aligned to ensure their consistency. * Existing expiry dates for
   public links can now be removed again. * We now use the Luxon `DateTime` object
   more consistently across the code base (replacing JavaScript's `new Date()).

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6084

* Bugfix - User email attribute initialization: [#6118](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6118)

   Until now, the user email would only be set if the user used it instead of a
   username in the login form. It now can also be set from the user webdav response
   as a fallback.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6118

* Bugfix - Contextmenu on public links: [#6123](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6123)

   We fixed an issue of the contextmenu not being displayed for the files table on
   public links.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6123

* Bugfix - Ensure route config is honored for new file handlers: [#6135](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6135)

   Only display the new file entries for the routes it belongs to.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6135

* Enhancement - Build options: [#5985](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985)

   Configure the startup title (displayed before the configuration is loaded) via
   env variable TITLE. Make the source map generation optional with the env
   variable SOURCE_MAP.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985

* Enhancement - Show feedback on startup: [#5985](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985)

   Instead of displaying an empty page while all components load, display a spiner.
   Also show an error message if there was an error.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5985

* Enhancement - Show errors when failing to open app in app provider: [#6003](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6003)

   The error message provided by wopi is now displayed to the user, giving some
   context on why it failed to open a file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6003

* Enhancement - Adopt oc-table-files from ods: [#6106](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6106)

   Ods oc-table-files always contained concrete web-app-files logic, to make
   development more agile and keep things close oc-table-files was renamed to
   resource-table and relocated to live in web-app-files from now on.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6106
   https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-design-system/pull/1817

* Enhancement - Update ODS to v12.0.0-alpha1: [#6106](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/6106)

   We have updated the extension handlers of two internal apps to be able to be
   used as default actions.

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Fix location picker breadcrumb url encoding: [#5940](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5940)

   The breadcrumb urls in location-picker were encoded. We've fixed this by
   removing the encoding.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5940
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5715

* Bugfix - Context menu rendering: [#5952](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5952)

   We fixed that the context menu was being created for each and every file row of
   the current page (it was just not made visible). Now it only gets created when
   it gets activated by the user for a file row.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/6010

* Enhancement - App provider and archiver on public links: [#5924](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5924)

   We made the app provider and archiver services available on public links. As a
   prerequisite for this we needed to make backend capabilities available on public
   links, which will be beneficial for all future extension development.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/2479
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2479

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5924

* Enhancement - Default action order: [#5952](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5952)

   We've changed the order of actions which are being considered as default action.

   3) system default actions. Previously the external apps took precedence.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5952

* Enhancement - Use default info from app provider: [#5962](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5962)

   The app provider returns information about the default application per mime
   type. This information is now respected when triggering the default action for a
   file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5962
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5970

   augmented with all menu items / apps from the classic UI. They open in a new tab
   in the classic UI and have a generic icon.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5996

* Enhancement - Reduced sidebar width: [#5981](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5981)

   We reduced the sidebar width to give the files list more horizontal room,
   especially on medium sized screens.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5981
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5983

* Enhancement - Rename `_chunks` folder to `chunks`: [#5988](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5988)

   We've renamed the `_chunks` folder to `chunks` in the ownCloud Web build output
   in order to make it more easily embedable with the Go embed directive.

Details
-------

* Bugfix - New Collaborator removes wrong autocomplete items: [#5857](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5857)

   We've addressed that when you add new collaborators in the autocomplete and
   remove one from the autocompletion it always removes the last element.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5857
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5931

* Bugfix - Unnecessary redirects on personal page: [#5893](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5893)

   Navigating to all files could lead to loading resources twice, first resources
   from root (/) and second the resources from the homeFolder (options.homeFolder).
   We've fixed this by detecting those cases and only load resources for the
   homeFolder.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5085
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5875
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5893

* Bugfix - Clean router path handling: [#5894](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5894)

   This patch was already introduced earlier for the files application only. In the
   meantime we found out that this is also needed on different places across the
   ecosystem.

   We've refactored the way how the patch gets applied to the routes: It is now
   possible to set an individual route's `meta.patchCleanPath` to true.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4595#issuecomment-938587035
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5894

* Bugfix - External apps by shares: [#5907](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5907)

   Opening shares in "Shared with me" section was broken. We have added property
   `mimeType` by the build of a shared resource, so that the external apps can be
   found for it.

   We fixed passing the fileId property for the context actions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5906
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5907

* Bugfix - Fix duplicated event subscriptions: [#5910](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5910)

   In some cases it happened that subscriptions to certain topics happened multiple
   times. This is problematic in cases where it should happen only once, for
   example loading a resource which can result in multiple requests and a
   overlapping state.

   This is fixes by introducing the option to unsubscribe a event individually by a
   given token or for all on a given topic.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5875
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5910

* Bugfix - Fix overlapping requests in files app: [#5917](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5917)

   In some cases the files app tended to display the wrong resources when
   navigating quickly through the views. This happened because the resource
   provisioning step wasn't canceled. This is now fixed by using vue-concurrency
   which on a high level wraps iterable generators which are cancelable. We're
   using it to wrap the resource loading and cancel it as soon as the resource set
   is not needed anymore.

   It also improves the overall performance for the files app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5085
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5875
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5917

* Enhancement - Datepicker in Dropdown: [#5806](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5806)

   We have moved the datepicker for share expiration in the right sidebar into a
   dropdown to align it with the other elements when creating/editing shares.

* Enhancement - Refactor runtime boot process: [#5752](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5752)

   We have updated the way applications are being loaded in the web runtime. It
   does now feature a dedicated boot process, providing hooks that other
   applications can take advantage of.

* Enhancement - Move custom permissions to roles drop: [#5764](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5764)

   We've moved all the custom permissions (previously advanced permissions) in the
   sharing dialog into a dropdown which gets triggered by selecting the Custom
   permissions item in the roles dropdown.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5764
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5647

* Enhancement - Add wrapper app for external apps: [#5805](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5805)

   We have added a `external` app that can render apps coming from the oCIS
   AppProvider via iFrame.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5805

* Enhancement - Add AppProvider actions to fileactions: [#5805](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5805)

   If the AppProvider within oCIS communicates a matching application for the mime
   type of a file, there are now additional actions in the default actions and
   actions in both the contextmenu and the right sidebar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5805

* Enhancement - Multiple shared with me tables: [#5814](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5814)

   We have separated the single table on the shared with me page into up to three
   different tables: - pending shares - accepted shares - declined shares By
   default we show pending and accepted shares. There is navigation in place to
   switch over from the accepted to the declined shares and the other way around.
   Pending shares stay visible all the time since it's expected that users take
   immediate action on pending shares anyway.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5814
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5177

* Enhancement - Download as archive: [#5832](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5832)

   We've introduced archive downloads based on whether or not an archiver
   capability is present. The current implementation supports the archiver v2
   (a.k.a. the REVA implementation). Archive downloads are available in two
   different ways: - as action on a folder (right-click context menu or actions
   panel in the right sidebar) - as batch action for all selected files The
   implementation is currently limited to authenticated contexts. A public links
   implementation will follow soon.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5809
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5832

* Enhancement - Early store initialization: [#5874](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5874)

   We made sure that the store and auth get initialized as early as possible. With
   this we ensured that capabilities are always loaded as soon as applications
   start their initialization process.

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Pagination on Locationpicker: [#5715](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5715)

   Pagination on copying/moving files as well as page reloads when copying/moving
   files were broken. When changing the Vue router encoding, we fixed both issues.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5715

* Enhancement - Fetch file info in the Files sidebar: [#5570](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5570)

   We've started fetching the file info when a single item is selected and the
   Files sidebar is opened. With this change we have more information available in
   different lists e.g. private link in shared lists.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5570

   We have updated the Vue router (prior to version 4) encoding from
   `files%2Fall%2Ffolder` to `files/all/folder`. It was also needed to use the
   router query object instead of the params to store the current page pagination
   information.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5714
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5715

* Enhancement - Add missing tooltips: [#5723](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5723)

   to the detail view in the right sidebar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5735
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5730

* Enhancement - Switch filesize calculation base: [#5739](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5739)

   We've switched from base-2 to base-10 when calculating the displayed file-size
   to align it better with user expectations.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5739

* Enhancement - Show sharees as collapsed list of avatars: [#5758](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5758)

   We've introduced a collapsed list of avatars of sharees in the `People` panel of
   the right sidebar. On click we switch to showing the full list of sharees. With
   this additional intermediate state we were able to clean up the UI a bit for
   easier cognitive load.

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Load folder in Media viewer: [#5427](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5427)

   We've fixed the loading of a folder in the Media viewer extension. If a user
   reloads the Media viewer now, it load all the medias both in private and public
   context.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5427
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5585
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5710

* Bugfix - Escape file name in Media viewer: [#5593](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5593)

   We've started escaping the file name in the Media viewer extension so that a
   file with special characters in the name can still be loaded.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5593
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5655

* Bugfix - Handle loading and parsing errors when loading themes: [#5669](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5669)

   Adds graceful error handling of json parse errors when loading custom themes.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5669

* Enhancement - Refresh files list via breadcrumbs: [#2018](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2018)

   In the personal and public files lists we've added a click handler to the last
   breadcrumb item representing the current folder that reloads the files list.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2018
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5659

* Enhancement - Add multiple selection Sidebar: [#5164](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5164)

   We've changed the sidebar so if a user selects multiple files or folders he sees
   a detailed view of his selection in the sidebar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5164
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5630

* Enhancement - Toggle right sidebar: [#5165](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5165)

   We introduced a button above the files list to toggle the right sidebar
   (open/close). It always opens for the current selection model. If nothing is
   selected, the current folder will be shown in the right sidebar. With this we
   now allow sharing a folder when the user already navigated into it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5165
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5678
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5709

* Enhancement - Move file via drag and drop: [#5592](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5592)

   We've added moving files and folders via drag and drop to the files table view.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5592
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5588

* Enhancement - Enable live reload for changes to themes: [#5668](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5668)

   This allows live reloads to be triggered by changes to themes defined within the
   'packages/web-runtime/themes/**/*' folders, to facilitate efficient WYSIWYG
   development when wanting to customise the look and feel of the frontend.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5668

* Enhancement - Signout icon: [#5681](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5681)

   We changed the icon in the personal menu nav item for signing out based on
   recent user feedback.

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Use profile picture capability in avatars: [#5178](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5178)

   Requests for loading avatar profile pictures now only get sent if the backend
   communicates their availability in the capabilities.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5178

* Bugfix - Content Security Policy for OpenID Connect authentication: [#5536](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5536)

   We added CSP rules for allowing OpenID Connect authentication when running
   ownCloud Web as app in ownCloud 10.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5536

* Bugfix - Unnecessary quota requests: [#5539](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5539)

   We've removed requests that checked for a user's quota on pages where it was not
   relevant.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5539

* Bugfix - Send authentication on manifests.json: [#5553](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5553)

   We've changed that requests to manifest.json will use authentication, too.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5553

* Bugfix - Check names also for folders or files that currently are not visible: [#5583](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5583)

   We've changed the way how web checks if a file or folder exists. From now on it
   also include files from the current folder that actually are not visible.

   This was problematic in situations like the pagination, where a file or folder
   was not available in the current set of resources and the user tried to create a
   folder with the same name.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5583

* Bugfix - Left sidebar visibility in public links: [#5602](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5602)

   We fixed that the left sidebar was showing the navigation items of an
   authenticated context when visiting a public link as authenticated user.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5602

* Change - Add custom search service: [#5415](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5415)

   We've added `search` as another core app that can be utilized by other
   (third-party) frontend extensions to provide filter and search functionality.
   Please note that you need to add `search` to the `apps` array of your
   config.json file, otherwise the search bar with its global file search
   capabilities will disappear.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5415

* Enhancement - Dropdown actions in FilesTable: [#5102](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5102)

   Users can now access quick actions in a dropdown by clicking on the three-dots
   button or right-clicking on rows in the files table.

   We've also bumped the ownCloud Design System to version 8.3.0

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5102
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5103
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5551
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5554
   https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-design-system/releases/tag/v8.3.0

* Enhancement - New layout for context menu: [#5160](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5160)

   The new context menu in the files list received additional menu items and a
   clear separation into three sections.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5160
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5576

* Enhancement - Add filter & search to files app: [#5415](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5415)

   We've changed the existing searchbar to use the custom search service. It is now
   able to be used at the same time as a filter (on the frontend) and, if the
   backend is capable of search, as a search input.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5415

* Enhancement - Define the number of visible share recipients: [#5506](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5506)

   We've added a new configuration option `sharingRecipientsPerPage` to define how
   many recipients should be shown in the share recipients dropdown.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5506

* Enhancement - Prevent binding to only loopback IP when running in watch mode: [#5515](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5515)

   This is required when running the acceptance tests on Windows, it allows the
   selenium docker containers to access the frontend due to the host binding in
   rollup (when running `yarn serve`). Does not break any existing functionality.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5515

* Enhancement - Sidebar sliding panels navigation: [#5549](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5549)

   The sidebar now uses a ios like concept for navigate through the different
   actions in the sidebar. It replaces the accordion navigation entirely.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5523
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5549

* Enhancement - Refactor recipient autocomplete in people panel: [#5554](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5554)

   We've refactored the recipient autocomplete in people panel so that selected
   recipients are displayed directly in the autocomplete instead of the list below
   it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5554

* Enhancement - Load only opened panels: [#5569](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5569)

   Do not load panels in the Files extension sidebar until they are opened.

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Hide left sidebar navigation when switching routes: [#5025](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5025)

   On smaller screens, the left sidebar containing the extension navigation is
   collapsed. We've fixed that when the user expanded the sidebar and navigated to
   a different route the sidebar is collapsed again.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5025

* Bugfix - Make sure IDs in HTML are unique: [#5028](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5028)

   Quick action button IDs were repeated in every row of the file table, which
   isn't allowed in HTML (IDs must be unique per document). By changing to classes,
   this offense was resolved.

   The same goes for IDs in the people shares part of the sidebar where IDs are now
   appended with the share ID, which is necessary since they need to be both unique
   and referenced by ID for accessibility reasons.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5028
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5148

* Bugfix - Add docs link & fix translations on error page: [#5034](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5034)

   The MissingConfigPage had a translated paragraph that didn't work because of an
   presumably unallowed `<br/>` tag inside the text.

   Also, the link to the GitHub repo was replace with a link to the web docs and
   public rocket chat.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5034

* Bugfix - Translated user menu items: [#5042](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5042)

   Some of the user menu items were not correctly translated, which is now fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5042

* Bugfix - Resizeable html container: [#5052](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5052)

   We removed a critical accessibility offense by removing the hardcoded
   maximum-scale and allowing for user-scalable viewsizes.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5052

* Bugfix - Make skip to main content link visible: [#5118](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5118)

   We've fixed the z-index of the skip to main content link so that it is not
   hidden under different content anymore and is again visible on focus, with a
   visible focus border.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5118
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5167

* Bugfix - Hide "Create new public link" button: [#5126](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5126)

   The button to create new public links was visible even if the user lacked the
   permissions to create one. It is now being hidden unless the user is allowed to
   create a share of the respective file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5126

* Bugfix - Upsert resource in filestable: [#5130](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5130)

   When uploading an already existing resource in the filestable, we sometimes
   displayed both files in the filestable until the page got refreshed. We now
   check when uploading a file if it exists in the filestable and replace it there
   if that is the case.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5130

* Bugfix - Prevent scrolling issues: [#5131](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5131)

   In cases where the browser-window space was not enough to render all views the
   ui ended up with weird scrolling behavior.

   This has been fixed by restructuring the dom elements and giving them proper
   styles.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5131

* Bugfix - Keyboard navigation for copy to clipboard: [#5147](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5147)

   We've fixed that the buttons for copying (private/public) links to the clipboard
   were not usable via keyboard.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5147

* Bugfix - Avoid duplicate loading of resources: [#5194](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194)

   On the personal route, we had a redirect case where resources would be loaded
   twice, which now is fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194

* Bugfix - Reduced Thumbnail Size: [#5194](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194)

   We have greatly reduced the size of the images we request from the backend to
   display as thumbnail previews in order to minimize loading times.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194

* Bugfix - Add index route for the OC10 integration: [#5201](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5201)

   Added an index route for the OC10 integration which gets called when opening
   http://your-server/index.php/apps/web. The route basically redirects to the same
   URL while appending /index.html, as this is the correct URL for accessing the
   Web UI. Setting Web as default layout would result in an endless redirect loop
   otherwise.

   https://github.com/owncloud/core/issues/38799
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5201

* Bugfix - Show `0` as used quota if a negative number is given: [#5229](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5229)

   In the case if the server returns a negative number as used quota (what should
   not happen) show `0 B of 2 GB` and not only of ` 2 GB`

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5229

* Bugfix - Prevent `fileTypeIcon` to throw a TypeError: [#5253](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5253)

   The function would die with `TypeError: file.extension.toLowerCase is not a
   function` if `file.extension` was set to something that is not a string.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5253

* Bugfix - Do not call Vuex create store multiple times: [#5254](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5254)

   We've moved the create Vuex store logic into the index file of Web runtime to
   prevent initialising the store multiple times.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5254

* Bugfix - Center MediaViewer loading spinner: [#5270](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5270)

   The loading spinner in the media viewer app wasn't centered vertically since the
   wrapping element was to small. It has now been given a min-height of the current
   screen size.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5196
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5270

* Bugfix - Remove unnecessary Propfind requests: [#5340](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5340)

   In the the files-app views `Favorites`, `SharedViaLink`, `SharedWithMe` and
   `SharedWithOthers` we did a unnecessary propfind request to obtain the
   rootFolder which is not required there.

   This has been fixed by removing those requests.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5340

* Enhancement - Introduce image cache: [#3098](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3098)

   We have added a (configurable) cache for thumbnails and avatar images to avoid
   loading the same files over and over again.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3098
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194

* Enhancement - Use `oc-select` for role select: [#4937](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4937)

   We've used the new `oc-select` component from ODS for selecting role in people
   and public links accordions in the right sidebar. We are using this component to
   enable keyboard navigation when selecting the role.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4937

* Enhancement - Asynchronous loading of images: [#4973](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4973)

   Thumbnail and avatar images now get loaded in the background and don't block the
   main rendering of the user interface.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4973
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194

* Enhancement - Improve accessibility for the files sidebar: [#5000](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5000)

   We've did several improvements to enhance the accessibility on the files
   sidebar: - Transformed the file name to a h2 element - Transformed the "Open
   folder"-action to a link instead of a button - Transformed the favorite-star to
   a button-element - Adjusted aria-label of the favorite-star to describe what it
   does instead of its current state - Added a more descriptive close button label
   - Clicking outside of the sidebar now closes it - Removed the aria-label on the
   action buttons as they already include proper labels - Added a hint for screen
   readers if an action opens a new window/tab - Make sidebar header sticky

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5000
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5266

* Enhancement - Update owncloud Design System to v7.1.2: [#5002](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5002)

   - Lots of updates regarding accessibility topics - Removal of home icon in
   breadcrumbs, changed to "All files" link as breadcrumb root - Added aria-labels
   to all landmarks in sidebar and proper logo-alt attribute to image in sidebar

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5002
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5044
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5074
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5186
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5189

* Enhancement - Move hint in the Location picker under breadcrumbs: [#5008](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5008)

   We've moved the hint that is describing how to use the Location picker from
   sidebar under the breadcrumbs. There is navigation of the Files extension
   displayed in the sidebar now instead.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5008

* Enhancement - Improve accessibility on user menu: [#5010](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5010)

   Wrapped the user menu button in a nav element and added an aria-label which
   describes it as main navigation.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5010

* Enhancement - Use a proper definition list for the account settings page: [#5012](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5012)

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5012

* Enhancement - Enable focus trap in oc-modal: [#5013](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5013)

   After the recent changes in ODS, the oc-modal can now use a focus-trap which is
   a feature needed for accessibility-reasons.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5013

* Enhancement - Move breadcrumbs out of location picker heading: [#5020](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5020)

   We've moved the breadcrumbs element out of the location picker heading and moved
   it under it. The heading is now also reflecting the page title. We've also
   decreased the size of both breadcrumbs and action buttons so that they fit
   better together.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5020

* Enhancement - Add focus trap to left sidebar: [#5027](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5027)

   We've added a focus trap to the left sidebar on smaller resolutions when it's
   collapsible. If the sidebar is opened and focused, the focus stays within the
   sidebar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5027

* Enhancement - Improve a11y in the files sidebar peoples & shares section: [#5034](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5034)

   We've did several improvements to enhance the accessibility on the files
   sidebar: - Gave `role="presentation" to the collaborator avatar - Refactored
   `<span>` and `<div>` tags into `<p>` tags and unified translations a bit -
   Enhanced hints in the collaborator quick action buttons with collaborator name -
   Hide private links if the capability is not enabled - Set avatar-images to
   `:aria-hidden="true"` since they're only visual elements and can be hidden from
   screenreaders - Changed `<section>` wrapper around private link shares - Removed
   `<section>` wrapper around public link shares - Removed `<section>` wrapper
   around collaborators - Added screenreader-only explain texts regarding
   collaborator/share ownership - Added aria-label for share receiver section -
   Worked on unifying the way we handle translations: Focus on v-translate and
   $gettext() - Turn tags into `<ul> & <li>` list, add aria-labelledby to both tag
   list and resharer tag list - Translated "Open with $appName" for sidebar quick
   actions

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5034
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5043
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5121

* Enhancement - Remove autoclose on notifications: [#5040](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5040)

   The autoclose is now being handled in the design system component. The timeout
   can be set via property.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5040

* Enhancement - Improve accessibility on trash bin: [#5046](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5046)

   Add more context to the empty trash bin button text and only render it, if
   resources are present.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5046

* Enhancement - Button appearance: [#5053](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5053)

   Changed the appearance of the "accept/decline share" buttons in the "Shared With
   Me" file list so they actually look like buttons.

   Also changed the "Clear selection" button in the files table batch actions from
   `raw` to `outline` appearance.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5053
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5148

* Enhancement - OcTooltip: [#5055](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5055)

   instead of uikit's.

* Enhancement - Improve accessibility on new file menu: [#5058](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5058)

   We now use buttons instead of a-tags in the new file menu. Also fixed the
   double-focus per item when navigating via tab.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5058

* Enhancement - Use slots in the navigation sidebar: [#5105](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5105)

   In the new sidebar content is defined solely via slots. We've moved all the
   content into those slots so that the sidebar still gets displayed correctly.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5105

* Enhancement - Do not reset file selection when cancelling batch delete: [#5107](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5107)

   We've removed the reset selection method call when cancelling batch delete. If
   the user now cancels the delete dialog, the file selection stays as it was
   before displaying the dialog.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5107

* Enhancement - Send focus to "Add people" btn after closing Add/Edit panels: [#5129](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5129)

   We've started sending the focus to "Add people" button after the `Add` panel in
   the people accordion has been closed. Also, when editing a share the focus jumps
   back to the "Edit" button in the respective share after cancelling or confirming
   the action.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5129
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5146

* Enhancement - Improve a11y colors: [#5138](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5138)

   To get a11y compliant it's required that colors match a given contrast ratio to
   it's back-/fore-/ground. We improved this on:

   - all ODS components - all oc-color variables - oc-star in sidebar

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5138

* Enhancement - Confirmation message when copying links: [#5147](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5147)

   We've added confirmation messages (toasts) when a private or public link is
   copied to the clipboard.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5147

* Enhancement - Hide left sidebar if no navitems are present: [#5149](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5149)

   For extensions / pages without nav items and public link pages, we now hide the
   left sidebar to not confuse screen readers and give more screen space for the
   content.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5149

* Enhancement - Request cancellation: [#5163](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5163)

   Requests (e.g. loading of images) can now be pragmatically cancelled from the
   client side. Before, obsolete requests would still create load on the server and
   return results that then would be discarded by the web frontend.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5163
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194

* Enhancement - Focus breadcrumb on route change: [#5166](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5166)

   We now focus the current breadcrumb item when navigating to another page and
   announce the amount of files and folders in the folder the user has navigated
   to.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5166

* Enhancement - Accessible status indicators: [#5182](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5182)

   To make both the clickable (button) and the visible (icon) part of the status
   indicators in the files table accessible, we have added a description, in
   addition to the tooltip and `aria-label`.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5182

* Enhancement - TypeScript Support: [#5194](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194)

   We have added support for TypeScript and started to refactor parts of the
   codebase. This will help us provide clearer interfaces and catch bugs earlier.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194

* Enhancement - Visibility observer: [#5194](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194)

   By adding a visibility observer, we now only load image previews for those files
   that are close to the user's viewport. It is also equipped with a short waiting
   period so scrolling doesn't lead to an overload of requests.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5194

* Enhancement - Add pagination: [#5224](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5224)

   We've added pagination to all files lists. Current limit for displayed resources
   is 100.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5224
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5309

* Enhancement - Update ownCloud Design System to v7.4.2: [#5224](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5224)

   We've updated ownCloud Design System to version 7.4.2 to bring the new
   pagination component.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5224
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5292
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5319
   https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-design-system/releases/tag/v7.4.1
   https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-design-system/releases/tag/v7.4.2

* Enhancement - File editor mode: [#5226](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5226)

   We've added a parameter called `mode` to the different ways of opening a file
   editor. The mode can be `edit` or `create` and reflects whether the file editor
   was opened in an editing mode or in a creation mode.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5226
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5256

* Enhancement - Ability to update file resource fields: [#5311](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5311)

   We've introduced the ability to update individual resource fields only instead
   of updating the whole resource at once.

Summary
-------

* Bugfix - Correct sharee tag: [#5112](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5112)
* Bugfix - Correct navigation through "via"-tags: [#5122](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5122)
* Enhancement - Prompts leaving user about pending uploads: [#2590](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2590)
* Enhancement - Confirmation for public link deletion: [#5125](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5125)

* Enhancement - Configure previews: [#5159](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5159)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Correct sharee tag: [#5112](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5112)

   The tag _inside_ a shared folder always announced the current user as "owner",
   since the shares lookup didn't check for the parent folders' ownership. This has
   been fixed now and users get the correct tag (e.g. "Viewer", "Editor" etc) in
   the sidebar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5112

* Bugfix - Correct navigation through "via"-tags: [#5122](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5122)

   The "shared via X" link in the indirect share tag in the sidebar was navigating
   to the parent directory of the indirect share entry. This has been fixed for the
   collaborators sidebar section and the link target is the share entry itself now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5122

* Enhancement - Prompts leaving user about pending uploads: [#2590](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2590)

   Added an unload event listener that detects closes/ reloads/ navigates to
   another URL. Added prompt that ask for confirmation to leave site on unload
   events if uploads pending. Removed the event listener before destroy of
   component.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2590
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4840

* Enhancement - Confirmation for public link deletion: [#5125](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5125)

   The deletion of public links is an irreversible interaction and should be
   handled with more care since users might have bookmarked or shared with other
   people. We have added a confirmation modal now to prevent users from
   accidentally deleting public links.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5125

* Enhancement - Continuously deployed demo instance with latest Web: [#5145](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5145)

   Whenever a commit or merge to master happens, a demo instance with the latest
   Web build will be deployed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5145

* Enhancement - Configure previews: [#5159](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5159)

   We introduced a new config option to configure which file will be previewed. To
   do so, add `"options.previewFileExtensions": ["jpg", "txt"]` in the config.json
   file.

* Enhancement - Lazy file avatar loading: [#5073](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5073)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Improve web container: [#4942](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4942)

   The wrapping `index.html.ejs` had some minor problems with HTML validators which
   are now fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4942

* Bugfix - Display navigation for resolved private link: [#5023](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5023)

   We've fixed that the navigation in the left sidebar is visible for a resolved
   private link as well

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5023

* Bugfix - Fix z-index on the new file menu: [#5056](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5056)

   Added a z-index to files-view because it prevented the new file menu from having
   a higher z-index than the table headers. As a result the new file menu was being
   overlapped by them.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5056

* Bugfix - Editors for all routes: [#5095](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5095)

   If an extension doesn't define valid routes it should be allowed for all routes
   by default. That behaviour was not working properly and is fixed now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5095

* Enhancement - Enable files app search bar to be toggleable on a per-route basis: [#4815](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4815)

   Permits the search bar in the files app to be toggleable on a per-route basis as
   shown or hidden.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4815

* Enhancement - Use list for displaying added people: [#4915](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4915)

   We've changed the HTML elements in the people accordion when adding new people.
   People added via people autocomplete are now displayed in a list element to use
   correct structure for screen readers.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4915

* Enhancement - Accessibility improvements: [#4965](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4965)

   A lot of random changes: - Extracted some helper classes to ODS & unified their
   usage - Removed `<br>` tags that were incorrectly used for spacing - Used `<h4>`
   tags for headings in the files sidebar - Make skip-to-main button translate-able
   - Update searchbar label string - Renamed "personal files" to "all files" in
   routes (soft rename, due to changes in the future) - Updated ODS to v6.0.3,
   making row heights theme-able and bringing a more accessible avatar component
   that improves loading of users' profile pictures - Translate quick action
   labels/tooltips properly - Added a note about actions being available above the
   file list to the live region update for selection

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4965
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4975
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5030
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5088

* Enhancement - Show search button in search bar: [#4985](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4985)

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4985

* Enhancement - Implement proper direct delete: [#4991](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4991)

   We implemented a proper delete action for a single file instead of reusing the
   batch action for deleting multiple files. This also solves the issue with the
   checkbox being checked when opening the delete modal, which was not a11y
   compliant.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4991

* Enhancement - Focus management: [#4993](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4993)

   We added a mixin that makes it able to manage, record and reverse-replay the
   focus for the current document. The first components that using it are modal and
   sidebar in the files app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4992
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4993

* Enhancement - Align headline hierarchy: [#5003](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5003)

   Streamlined headline tags so that pages have a h1 tag and the headline hierarchy
   is adhered.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/5003
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5004
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5005

* Enhancement - Use real page title for location picker: [#5009](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5009)

   We've added real page titles to the location picker. The title is consisted of
   the current action, target and product name.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5009

* Enhancement - Extension config: [#5024](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5024)

   Loading extension specific config was only possible for file editors. We now
   also load it in the general app information, so that it's available in the
   `apps` getter of the global vuex store.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5024

* Enhancement - Lazy file avatar loading: [#5073](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/5073)

   We've changed the way how large file lists get rendered. In some cases where we
   had a long list of files, the loading of avatars could lead to long waiting
   times till the first paint happens.

   Now we first render the list of files, load the associated avatars in the
   background and then update the ui.

* Enhancement - Use ODS translations: [#4934](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4934)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Only one `<main>` tag per HTML document: [#1652](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1652)

   Only one `<main>` tag is allowed per HTML document. This change removes the ones
   in `web-container` and `web-runtime` and adds one to each extension (files-list,
   mediaviewer, markdowneditor, drawio) since they can't be loaded at the same
   time.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1652
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4627

* Bugfix - Avatar url without double slash: [#4610](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4610)

   The avatar url added another superfluous slash after the instance url which
   resulted in the avatar not being able to load.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4610
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4849

* Bugfix - Open mediaviewer for upper case file extensions: [#4647](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4647)

   We fixed a bug where the mediaviewer didn't open for files which had an
   uppercase (or mixed case) file extension.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4647
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4627

* Bugfix - Parent paths traversal for shares: [#4860](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4860)

   We fixed a bug in parent paths traversals for loading shares. A path with a
   trailing slash was twice in the result of (parent-)paths, leading to fetching
   the existing shares on the current folder twice. Since we fetch incoming and
   outgoing shares this caused 2 unnecessary requests on every page load that
   changed into a child folder or a folder unrelated to the current path.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4860
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4918

* Change - New files list: [#4627](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4627)

   We integrated the new oc-table-files component from our design system. This
   includes breaking changes in how we load resources in our files app. We
   refactored our files app codebase into views, so that only subcomponents live in
   the components directory.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4627

* Change - Update owncloud Design System to v6.0.1: [#4940](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4940)

   - Lots of updates regarding accessibility topics, an updated color palette and
   custom CSS properties to allow for (runtime) theming. - ODS started to use
   peerDependencies now, we adopted this and added the required packages

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4331
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4940
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4925
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4862
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4983

* Enhancement - A11y improvements for files app bar: [#4786](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4786)

   If we select resources in the files list, an action context menu appears, to
   improve a11y we need an aria live region element to announce that.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4786
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4833

* Enhancement - Implement live region updates on route changes: [#4812](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4812)

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4346
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4812

* Enhancement - Enable files app search bar to be toggleable on a per-route basis: [#4815](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4815)

   Permits the search bar in the files app to be toggleable on a per-route basis as
   shown or hidden.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4815

* Enhancement - Runtime theming: [#4822](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4822)

   It's now possible to specify a custom theme and have logos, brand slogan and
   colors changed to modify the appearance of your ownCloud web frontend.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2362
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4822

* Enhancement - Add "Shared via link" page: [#4881](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4881)

   We've added a new page called "Shared via link". This page displays a files list
   containing only resources shared via public links.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4881

* Enhancement - Add web-pkg package: [#4907](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4907)

   We added web-pkg as a new package. It is supposed to be the central location for
   reuse of generic functionality.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4907

* Enhancement - Use list for displaying added people: [#4915](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4915)

   We've changed the HTML elements in the people accordion when adding new people.
   People added via people autocomplete are now displayed in a list element to use
   correct structure for screen readers.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4915

* Enhancement - Use ODS translations: [#4934](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4934)

   Some ODS components were using their own translation strings which were
   available in the ODS but not exported there/imported in the web project. Now, we
   import the translation strings from the ODS package and merge them with the web
   translations.

Details
-------

   We don't support 'userGroup' (originally 'contact', shareType `2`) on the
   backend side anymore, so we delete it on the frontend, too.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4809

* Bugfix - NODE_ENV based on rollup mode: [#4819](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4819)

   The NODE_ENV was set to production by default, now we use development if rollup
   is started in watch mode so that the vue devtools can be used.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4819
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4820

   For a11y the html language attribute will be set dynamically <html lang="xx"/>.
   For a11y the title will be set automatically following the schema: sub item (e.G
   file) - route (e.g All Files) - general name (e.g ownCloud)

* Enhancement - Set locale on moment-js to render translated strings: [#4826](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4826)

   For i18n purposes we set the moment-js locale to the current selected locale
   (language) this allows us to show translated string for example in the updated
   column in the All files list (web-app-files package)

* Enhancement - Use pre-signed url download for password protected shares: [#38376](https://github.com/owncloud/core/pull/38376)

   Replaced the blob download with a normal download using a pre-signed url
   provided by the backend.

Changelog for ownCloud Web [2.0.2] (2021-03-08)
=======================================
The following sections list the changes in ownCloud web 2.0.2 relevant to
ownCloud admins and users.

[2.0.2]: https://github.com/owncloud/web/compare/v2.0.1...v2.0.2

* Change - Suppress redirect error during authorization: [#4759](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4759)

* Change - Suppress redirect error during authorization: [#4759](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4759)

   We've suppressed the error appearing in the console which warned about redirect
   happening after the oidc callback page. This error is being shown because after
   the oidc callback has successfully processed the authorization request we are
   redirecting to the `/` path which immediately does another redirect to the
   extension set as default one. In the context of Vue router, this is considered
   an error even though for us it is a valid use case. The error is only
   informative thus no issue is going to surface if we suppress it. This way we are
   getting closer to a clean console without errors.

* Bugfix - Allow search in additional share info: [#1656](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1656)
* Bugfix - Fix showing white page with no message if the config could not be parsed: [#4636](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4636)
* Bugfix - Fix oc10 deployment after switch to rollup: [#4757](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4757)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Allow search in additional share info: [#1656](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1656)

   We fixed that searching for a potential sharee didn't look at the additional
   share info.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1656
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4753

* Bugfix - Fix showing white page with no message if the config could not be parsed: [#4636](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4636)

   When the config file could not be parsed because of some mistake in the JSON, an
   empty page without any error message would be shown to the user. We've fixed
   that behavior and showing now an error page and details of the error in the
   console.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4636
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4749

* Bugfix - Fix oc10 deployment after switch to rollup: [#4757](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4757)

   Our first release of the oc10 app after the switch to rollup as bundler had a
   bug as it didn't reflect the new folder structure of the app in the allowed
   folders. This has been fixed by updating the allowed folders.

Changelog for ownCloud Web [2.0.0] (2021-02-16)
=======================================
The following sections list the changes in ownCloud web 2.0.0 relevant to
ownCloud admins and users.

Summary
-------

* Change - Switch from webpack to rollup: [#4584](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4584)
* Change - Update ODS to 2.1.2: [#4594](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4594)

Details
-------

* Change - Switch from webpack to rollup: [#4584](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4584)

   We replaced the bundler that we used so far (webpack) with rollup and
   reorganized the project structure. This hopefully makes the project structure
   easier to understand and thus help with onboarding. Another improvement is that
   the overall bundle size is much smaller now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4584

* Change - Update ODS to 2.1.2: [#4594](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4594)

   We updated the ownCloud Design System to 2.1.2. See the linked releases for
   details.

The following sections list the changes in ownCloud web 1.0.1 relevant to
ownCloud admins and users.

[1.0.1]: https://github.com/owncloud/web/compare/v1.0.0...v1.0.1

Summary
-------

* Bugfix - Fully clickable sidebar toggle button: [#4130](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4130)
* Bugfix - Allow server URL without trailing slash: [#4536](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4536)
* Change - Allow to disable previews in file lists: [#4513](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4513)

* Change - Rename confirmation of copy action: [#4590](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4590)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Fully clickable sidebar toggle button: [#4130](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4130)

   The button for hiding/showing the left sidebar (burger menu) was not fully
   clickable. We fixed this by removing a negative margin that pulled the rest of
   the topbar over the button.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/4130
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4572

* Bugfix - Allow server URL without trailing slash: [#4536](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4536)

   The server URL in the config was leading to issues resolving resources when it
   had no trailing slash. We are now checking if the trailing slash is missing and
   add it upon applying the config if needed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4536

* Change - Allow to disable previews in file lists: [#4513](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4513)

   We introduced a new config option to disable previews. To do so, set
   `"disablePreviews": true` to the config.json file.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4513

* Change - Add controllers for oc10 app deployment: [#4537](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4537)

   We added a config endpoint for when ownCloud Web is deployed as ownCloud 10 app.
   The config.json file must not be placed in the apps folder because it would
   cause the app integrity check to fail. In addition to the config endpoint we
   added a wildcard endpoint for serving static assets (js bundles, css, etc) of
   the ownCloud Web javascript application by their paths.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4537

* Change - Rename confirmation of copy action: [#4590](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4590)

   We've changed the label of the confirmation button in copy view. Instead of
   "Copy here", we used "Paste here".

* Enhancement - Update ODS to 2.0.4: [#45001](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/45001)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Enable route checks for file actions: [#986](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/986)

   The checks on which route an extension is enabled were not active (and
   inverted). We fixed this so that editors only appear on configured routes now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/986
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4436

* Bugfix - Fix navigation rendering: [#1031](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1031)

   - ADD_NAV_ITEM mutation now gets copied instead of referenced to trigger a state
   change. - applicationsList navItem item needs a copy instead of mutating the
   base item - check for route.path instead of route name in ADD_NAV_ITEM which can
   change over time

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1031
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1043
   https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix/pull/4430

* Bugfix - Hide modals on logout: [#1064](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1064)

   Hide shown modal if user gets logged out while it's visible

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1064
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4472

* Bugfix - Do not use origin location to open editors: [#4500](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4500)

   When opening the editors view in a new tab, we were using the origin of
   location. This would break in case we have Web deployed to a different path than
   root e.g. `http://owncloud/apps/web`.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4500

* Bugfix - Fix role selection for public links: [#4504](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4504)

   The dropdown for the role selection in public links was not working anymore -
   the model didn't react to selections. Fixed it by bringing back a field that was
   accidentally removed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4504

* Enhancement - Wait for all required data: [#884](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/884)

   Before this we rendered the ui no matter if every required data already is
   loaded or not. For example the current users language from the ocis settings
   service. One potential problem was the flickering in the ui or that the default
   language was shown before it switches to the settings language of current user.
   Instead we now show a loading screen and wait for everything that is required
   before rendering anything else.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/884
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1043

* Enhancement - Add the option to decline accepted shares: [#985](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/985)

   Declined shares could be accepted retroactively but accepted shares could not be
   declined.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/985

* Enhancement - Show status of accepted shares: [#985](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/985)

   The status column of accepted shares was blank.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/985

* Enhancement - Position of main dom node: [#1052](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1052)

   Div#main is now positioned relative, this way child apps are able to orientate
   their containers absolute to it.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4489
   https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-design-system/pull/1002

* Enhancement - Add custom configuration to the draw.io app: [#4337](https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix/pull/4337)

   Added mechanism to specify custom configuration instead of using a hardcoded
   one. The new settings include support for a custom draw.io server, enabling
   autosave and using a specific theme.

   https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix/issues/4328
   https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix/pull/4337

* Enhancement - Add support for .vsdx files in the draw.io app: [#4337](https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix/pull/4337)

   Added the support to open .vsdx files (Microsoft Visio Files) directly from
   OwnCloud, instead of creating a new diagram to import the file from local
   storage.

   https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix/issues/4327
   https://github.com/owncloud/phoenix/pull/4337

* Enhancement - Add oc10 app build artifact: [#4427](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4427)

   We've added a build step to the release process which creates an ownCloud Web
   bundle which can be deployed as an app to ownCloud 10.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4427

* Enhancement - Update ODS to 2.0.3: [#4488](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4488)

   We've updated the ownCloud design system to version 2.0.3.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4488
   https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-design-system/releases/tag/v2.0.3

* Enhancement - Extend default apps: [#4493](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4493)

   When release tarballs are created, we are copying the config.json.dist into them
   as a default config. In that file were so far only "files" app enabled. This
   adds also "media viewer" and "draw-io" into apps enabled by default.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4493

* Enhancement - Update ODS to 2.0.4: [#45001](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/45001)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Public link glitches: [#1028](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1028)

   We fixed a couple of glitches with public links: - Creating a folder in a public
   link context was showing an error message although the folder was created
   correctly. This was happening because reloading the current folder didn't take
   the public link context into account. - For public links with editor role the
   batch actions at the top of the files list were not showing. The public links
   route didn't have a specific flag for showing the batch actions. - Quick actions
   for sharing are not available in public link contexts by design. The check
   printed an error in the javascript console though. We made this check silent
   now.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/1028
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4425

* Change - Use labels to display share info: [#4410](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4410)

   We've changed the way of displaying share information for public links and
   people. Every information is now displayed in its own label.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4410

* Enhancement - Display full public and private links: [#4410](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4410)

   Below the names of public and private links we've added the respective full URL
   so that users can copy it without the copy to clipboard button.

* Bugfix - Don't break file/folder names in text editor: [#4391](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4391)
* Change - Configurable home path: [#4411](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4411)
* Change - Show dedicated 404 page for invalid resource references: [#4411](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4411)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Don't break file/folder names in text editor: [#4391](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4391)

   The label in the text editor that displays the path of the active file was
   removing the first character instead of trimming leading slashes. This might
   have lead to situations where actual characters were removed. We fixed this by
   only removing leading slashes instead of blindly removing the first character.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4391

* Change - Configurable home path: [#4411](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4411)

   We introduced a config.json option `homeFolder` which let's you specify a
   default location when opening the `All files` view. Please refer to the
   documentation for details.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4411
   https://owncloud.github.io/clients/web/getting-started/

* Change - Show dedicated 404 page for invalid resource references: [#4411](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4411)

   When visiting a public link or the `All files` page with an invalid resource in
   the URL (e.g. because it was deleted in the meantime) we now show a dedicated
   page which explains that the resource could not be found and offers a link to go
   back to the respective root (»All files« home location or the root of the
   public link). The breadcrumbs have been made available on invalid resources as
   well, so that those could be used for more precise navigation instead of jumping
   back to the root.

* Change - Load extensions config: [#4380](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4380)
* Change - Configurable default extension: [#4382](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4382)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Unavailable extensions causing route duplication: [#4382](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4382)

   There was an error in the extension loading handlers which caused routes to be
   loaded multiple times when extensions from the config.json were unavailable. We
   hardened the extension loading handlers to just skip those extensions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4382

* Change - Load extensions config: [#4380](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4380)

   We've started loading the config of extensions which can now be defined as an
   object in the `external_apps` in the config.json.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4380

* Change - Configurable default extension: [#4382](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4382)

   We introduced a config option in the config.json file which allows to configure
   the default extension for ownCloud Web. Any of the configured extension ids can
   be chosen as default extension. If none is provided, we fall back to the files
   extension.

   The file type icon mappings contained some mappings to non-existing icon files.
   We fixed those.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4357

* Bugfix - Fix edit public link view: [#4374](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4374)

   We've fixed the issue that edit public link view in the sidebar was overlapping
   with the versions accordion.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4374

* Enhancement - Use handler of file editors: [#4324](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4324)

   In case the extension is a file editor which defines a custom handler, we are
   triggering that handler instead of trying to open any assigned route.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4324

* Enhancement - Theme redirect and access denied pages: [#4373](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4373)

   We've adjusted the theme on OIDC redirect and access denied pages to use correct
   logo and background. We've also added those two values into the theming
   capabilities.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4373

* Enhancement - Update ODS to 2.0.0: [#4373](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4373)

* Bugfix - Make available file actions (more) aware of the page context: [#4255](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4255)

   The list of available file actions sometimes contained actions which should not
   be possible and sometimes was missing actions that should be possible. Most
   important examples are that copy/move should not be available on `shared with
   me` and `shared with others` pages (but they were) and that the set of file
   actions from the `All files` page should also be available for the favorites
   page (but were not).

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4255

* Bugfix - Fix loginAsUser: [#4297](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4297)

   LoginAsUser wasn't waiting until the loading finished. Added an additional check

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4297

* Change - File actions as accordion item in right sidebar: [#4255](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4255)

   We moved the menu items from `file actions` dropdown menu (the "three dots
   menu") as accordion item into the right sidebar and made it the default item to
   be opened when clicking the three dots. For the sake of consistency we now also
   made the right sidebar available for the `Deleted files` page, where we offer
   the actions accordion item with a `Restore` and `Delete` action.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4255

* Enhancement - Added support for OpenID Connect Dynamic Client Registration 1.0: [#4286](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4286)

   OwnCloud Web can use the dynamic client registration protocol to exchange client
   id and client secret with the IdP

* Bugfix - Make file previews properly fit: [#232](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/232)

   We've fixed the file preview to prevent overflowing vertically and also added
   CSS property to make sure the ratio is preserved

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/232
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4073

* Bugfix - Adjust behavior of public link password field: [#4077](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4077)

   The UX of the public link password field has been improved. The field is
   focussed automatically and the enter key submits the password. Also, in case of
   wrong password, an error message is now displayed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/231
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4077

* Bugfix - Added missing tooltips: [#4081](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4081)

   We've added tooltips for the following:

   - top bar: notifications button and application switcher - file list: share
   indicators and quick actions - sharing in sidebar: action icons like edit,
   delete, copy

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/231
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4081

* Change - Add default action to click on file name: [#234](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/234)

   When clicking on the file name in the files list, a default action is triggered
   which opens the first available file editor or viewer. If no file editor or
   viewer is available, the default action falls back to download.

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/234
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4076
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4097

* Change - Moved bottom actions menu into actions dropdown: [#234](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/234)

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4076

* Change - Renamed collaborators to people: [#4070](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4070)

   All visible occurrences of "collaborator" or "collaborators" have been replaced
   by "person" or "people" respectively. Additionally, the action "Add
   Collaborator" was changed to "Share".

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/231
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4070

* Change - Rename "trash bin" to "deleted files": [#4071](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4071)

   We've renamed the "trash bin" to the more appropriate wording "deleted files".

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/231
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4071

* Change - Shortened button label for creating public links: [#4072](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4072)

   The label of the button for creating public links in the links panel has been
   shortened to "Public link" instead of "Add public link" since the plus sign
   already implies adding. An Aria label has been added for clarification when
   using screen readers.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/231
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4072

* Change - Adjustments to roles selection dropdown: [#4080](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4080)

   The role description text from the roles selection button has been removed, but
   is still visible when opening the dropdown. The dropdown now also has a chevron
   icon to make it clearer that it is a dropdown.

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/231
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4080

* Change - Update ODS to 1.11.0: [#4086](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4086)

   We updated owncloud design system (ODS) to 1.11.0. This brings some features and
   required some changes: - Buttons: - require to be placed in a grid or with
   uk-flex for side by side positioning, - don't have an icon property anymore, -
   have a slot so that content of the button can be just anything - placement of
   the content in the button can be modified with new props `justify-content` and
   `gap` - new icons, which are used in the sidebar and for quick actions - sidebar
   has a property for hiding the navigation. It doesn't have internal logic anymore
   for hiding the navigation automatically.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4086

* Change - Improve external links in app switcher: [#4092](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4092)

   We have added an option to set the link target in external application links
   (defaults to `_blank`). The app switcher now shows all native extensions first
   and items based on application links last.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4092

* Change - More descriptive loading state: [#4099](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4099)

   When browsing the different variations of the files list we removed the loader
   component at the top in favor of a spinner in the center of the viewport. The
   spinner has one line of text which describes what kind of data is being loaded.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4099

* Enhancement - Remember public link password on page refresh: [#4083](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/4083)

   When refreshing the page in the file list of a public link share, the user
   doesn't need to enter the password again. This only applies for the current page
   and the password is forgotten by the browser again upon closing or switching to
   another site.

   We've fixed the display name when running ocis-web with oCIS as backend. The
   display name is now again displayed in the top bar and in the account page.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3938

* Change - Provide option for hiding the search bar: [#116](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/116)

   We introduced a new `options.hideSearchBar` config variable which can be used to
   disable the search bar entirely.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3817

* Change - Move information about current folder below the files list: [#120](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/120)

   Previously this information was always displayed on the bottom of the screen.

* Change - Get rid of static "Shared with:" label: [#123](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/123)

   We removed the static "Shared with:" text label in the indicator row of file
   items. From now on, if a file item has no indicators, it will fall back to the
   one-row layout (resource name vertically centered).

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/123
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3808

* Change - Differentiate between user-id and username: [#440](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/440)

   With oCIS user-id and username are not the same as is the case in ownCloud 10.
   We've started differentiating between them to correctly display all information
   in the accounts page. If the username is not available (oC10), we fall back to
   using user-id as the username.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis/issues/440
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3938

* Change - Large file downloads support with URL signing: [#3797](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3797)

   of downloading as BLOB.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3797

* Change - Use pre-signed URLs in media viewer: [#3803](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3803)

   We've started using pre-signed URLs if supported in media viewer to display
   images instead of fetching them.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3803
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3844

* Change - Move docs about hugo usage to ocis: [#3828](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3828)

   cross-extension topic, we have moved it to our main ocis docs.

* Bugfix - Fix navigation to the root folder from location picker: [#3756](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3756)

   The target location in the location picker was appending a whitespace when
   trying to go to root folder. This resulted in an error when trying to load such
   folder. We've removed the whitespace to fix the navigation.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3756

* Change - Don't fallback to appId in case the route of file action is not defined: [#69](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/69)

   When opening a file in a editor or a viewer the path was falling back to an
   appId. This made it impossible to navigate via the file actions into an app
   which doesn't have duplicate appId in the route. We've stopped falling back to
   this value and in case that the route of the file action is not defined, we use
   the root path of the app.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3677

* Change - Do not display outline when the files list is focused: [#3747](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3747)

   The files list was displaying outline when it received focus after a click.
   Since the focus is meant only programmatically, the outline was not supposed to
   be displayed.

   different locations. The move operation is executed in a new page called
   Location picker.

* Enhancement - Add ability to copy files and folders into a different location: [#102](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/102)

* Bugfix - Remove anchor on last breadcrumb segment: [#3722](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3722)

   The last segment of the breadcrumb was clickable, while it's expected that
   nothing happens (as it is the current path). We fixed that, the last breadcrumb
   element is not clickable anymore.

The following sections list the changes in ownCloud web 0.11.1 relevant to
ownCloud admins and users.

[0.11.1]: https://github.com/owncloud/web/compare/v0.11.0...v0.11.1

Summary
-------

* Bugfix - Do not expand the width of resource name over it's content: [#3685](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3685)
* Bugfix - Public upload now keeps modified time: [#3686](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3686)
* Change - Use "Shared with" as a label for indicators: [#3688](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3688)
* Enhancement - Update owncloud-sdk to 1.0.0-663: [#3690](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3690)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Do not expand the width of resource name over it's content: [#3685](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3685)

   The width of the resource name in the files list was expanded more than the
   actual width of it's content. This caused that when clicked outside of the
   resource name, the action to navigate or open the resource has been triggered
   instead of opening the sidebar. We've fixed the width that it is now equal to
   the width of the content.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3685
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3687

* Bugfix - Public upload now keeps modified time: [#3686](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3686)

   The public upload for public links now keeps the modification time of local
   files. This aligns the behavior with non-public file upload.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3686

* Change - Use "Shared with" as a label for indicators: [#3688](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3688)

   Instead of "State" we've started using the "Shared with" as a label for the
   indicators in the files list. This is only intermediate solution because the
   indicators can be extended by other indicators which don't have to be related to
   sharing.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3688

* Enhancement - Update owncloud-sdk to 1.0.0-663: [#3690](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3690)

   We've updated the owncloud-sdk to version 1.0.0-663. This version stops
   rejecting sharing promises if the passed shareID is not an integer.

* Bugfix - Add missing question mark to delete confirmation dialog in trashbin: [#3566](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3566)

   We've added missing question mark to the delete confirmation dialog inside of
   the trashbin.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3566

* Bugfix - Fix empty settings values: [#3602](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3602)

   We've updated owncloud-sdk to version 1.0.0-638 which makes sure that an empty
   array gets returned whenever there are no settings values for the authenticated
   user. Previously having no settings values broke our detection of whether
   settings values finished loading.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-settings/issues/24

   supported.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3674
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3679

* Bugfix - Set default permissions to public link quick action: [#3675](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3675)

   We've set a default permissions when creating a new public link via the quick
   actions. The permissions are set to `1`.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3675
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3678

* Bugfix - Set empty object when resetting current sidebar tab: [#3676](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3676)

   We've changed the argument from `null` to an empty object when resetting the
   current tab of the sidebar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3676
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3678

* Change - Remove sidebar quickAccess: [#80](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/80)

   We have removed the sidebar quickAccess extension point. To create an quick
   access to the sidebar, we need to use the quickActions extension point.

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/80
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3586

* Change - Rework account dropdown: [#82](https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/82)

   We've removed user avatar, user email and version from the account dropdown. The
   log out button has been changed into a link. All links in account dropdown are
   now inside of a list.

   https://github.com/owncloud/product/issues/82
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3605

* Change - Use correct logo: [#786](https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-design-system/issues/786)

   We've changed the ownCloud logo which is used in the default theme. The previous
   logo had an incorrect font-weight.

   https://github.com/owncloud/owncloud-design-system/issues/786
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3604

* Change - Bring new modal component: [#2263](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2263)

   We've updated our modal component with a new one coming from ODS.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2263
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3378

* Change - Unite files list status indicators: [#3567](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3567)

   We've merged direct and indirect status indicators in the files list. With this
   change, we focus on the important information of the indicator (e.g. resource is
   shared). Any additional information can then be displayed in the related tab of
   the sidebar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3567

* Change - Move status indicators under the resource name: [#3617](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3617)

   We've moved the sharing status indicators from an own column in the files list
   to a second row under the resource name.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3617

* Change - Move create new button: [#3622](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3622)

   We've moved the create new button in the files app bar to the left directly next
   to breadcrumbs.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3622

* Enhancement - Use TUS settings from capabilities: [#177](https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/177)

   The TUS settings advertise the maximum chunk size, so we now use the smallest
   chunk size from the one configured in config.json and the one from the
   capabilities.

   If the capabilities report that one should use the X-HTTP-Override-Method
   header, the upload will now use a POST request for uploads with that header set
   instead of PATCH.

   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-reva/issues/177
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3568

* Enhancement - Send mtime with uploads: [#2969](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2969)

   When uploading a file, the modification time is now sent along. This means that
   the uploaded file will have the same modification time like the one it had on
   disk. This aligns the behavior with the desktop client which also keeps the
   mtime.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2969
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3377

* Enhancement - Dynamically loaded nav items: [#3497](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3497)

   We have moved the navItems from application configuration into a store module.
   We extended it's functionality by introducing statically and dynamically loaded
   navItems. This way navItems can be loaded based on extension data, as soon as
   the extension becomes active. Please note that having at least one static
   navItem (coming from the appInfo object of an extension) is still a requirement
   for the extension appearing in the app switcher.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3497
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3570

* Enhancement - Add collaborators quick action: [#3573](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3573)

   We've added a new quick action which opens the new collaborators tab in the
   files list sidebar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3573

* Enhancement - Load and display quick actions: [#3573](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3573)

   We've added an extension point into files apps for quick actions. By creating
   and exporting an object called quickActions, developers can define an action
   which will be then displayed in the files list.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3454

* Change - Removed favorite button from file list and added it in the sidebar: [#1987](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1987)

   We've removed the favorite star button in the file list and added instead a

   also added a new action in the file action dropdown menu which allows you to
   toggle the favorite status of your file.

   web and all extensions.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3484

* Change - Use language setting: [#3484](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3484)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Remove deleted files from search result: [#3266](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3266)

   Deleted file has been removed from filesSearched state by adding a new mutation.
   Also, filter condition in remove file mutations has been changed from object
   reference to unique file id.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3043
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3044
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3266

* Bugfix - Show token string if link name is empty in FileLinkSidebar: [#3297](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3297)

   Owncloud-js-client was parsing empty link name xml attribute as empty object.
   The empty object was changed with an empty string. Also, FileLinkSidebar
   behaviour fixed by showing token as name for the link shares without a name.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2517
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3297

* Bugfix - Remove duplicate error display in input prompt: [#3342](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3342)

   Validation errors within the input prompt dialog were showing up twice. One of
   them is a leftover from the old version. We've fixed the dialog by removing the
   old validation error type.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3342

* Bugfix - Fix translation message extraction from plain javascript files: [#3346](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3346)

   https://github.com/Polyconseil/easygettext/issues/81
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3346

* Bugfix - Fix name of selected extension on broken apps: [#3376](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3376)

   With the edge case of a broken app in config.json, the top bar is broken,
   because appInfo can't be loaded. We made ocis-web more robust by just showing
   the extension id in the top bar when the appInfo is not available.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3376

* Change - Update owncloud-sdk: [#3369](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3369)

   Updated owncloud-sdk to v1.0.0-604

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3369

* Enhancement - Add chunked upload with tus-js-client: [#67](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/67)

   Whenever the backend server advertises TUS support, uploading files will use TUS
   as well for uploading, which makes it possible to resume failed uploads. It is
   also possible to optionally set a chunk size by setting a numeric value for
   "uploadChunkSize" in bytes in config.json.

   When saving a collaborator has failed, the UI was still behaving like it saved

   After the logout the idp sent a redirect to `<redirectUri>?state=` which was
   then redirected to `<redirectUri>?state=#/login` by web. Having the query
   parameters in between broke the application. To prevent the whole login url
   `<baseUrl>#/login` should be sent then the query parameter will be appended to
   the end.

* Bugfix - Fix media-viewer on private pages: [#3288](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3288)

   Media-viewer incorrectly assumed it was on a public page when opened from a
   private page.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3288

* Bugfix - Update owncloud-sdk 1.0.0-544: [#3292](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3292)

   This sdk version is much smaller in size

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3292

* Bugfix - Set a higher timeout for requirejs: [#3293](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3293)

   In slow networks requirejs requests can timeout. The timeout is now set to a
   higher value (200 secs)

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3293

* Enhancement - Visual improvement to errors in input prompts: [#1906](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1906)

   We've adjusted the input prompts to show a visually less prominent text below
   the input field. Also, error messages now appear with a small delay, so that
   those happening during typing get ignored (e.g. trailing whitespace is not
   allowed in folder names and previously caused an error to show on every typed
   blank).

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3240

* Enhancement - Add state to app urls: [#3294](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3294)

   Currently opened file can be added to app routes so reloading the page can be
   made to work For now it's only implemented in mediaviewer

* Enhancement - Added thumbnails in file list: [#276](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/276)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Fix logout when no tokens are known anymore: [#2961](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2961)

   Single Log Out requires the id_token and in cases where this token is no longer
   known calling the SLO endpoint will result in an error.

   This has been fixed.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2961

* Bugfix - Files list status indicators are now appearing without any delay: [#2973](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2973)

   We've stopped loading file list status indicators asynchronously to prevent them
   from appearing delayed. They appear now at the same time as the file list.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2973
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3213

* Bugfix - Fix file actions menu when using OCIS backend: [#3214](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3214)

   When using OCIS as backend, the ids of resources is a string instead of integer.
   So we cannot embed those into DOM node ids and need to use another alternative.
   This fix introduces a unique viewId which is only there to provide uniqueness
   across the current list and should not be used for any data related operation.

   This fixes the file actions menu when using OCIS as backend.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3214
   https://github.com/owncloud/ocis-web/issues/51

* Bugfix - Do not remove first character of etag: [#3274](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3274)

   When stripping away double quotes in etag of the file thumbnails, we
   accidentally removed first character as well. We've stopped removing that
   character.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3274

* Change - Don't import whole core-js bundle directly into core: [#3173](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3173)

   We've stopped importing whole core-js bundle directly into core and instead load
   only used parts with babel.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3173

* Enhancement - Added thumbnails in file list: [#276](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/276)

   Thumbnails are now displayed in the file list for known file types. When no
   thumbnail was returned, fall back to the file type icon.

* Bugfix - Indirect share info now visible in favorite and other file lists: [#3040](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3040)

   When open the share panel of other flat file lists like the favorites, the
   collaborators list and link list are now showing the same entries like in the
   "All files" list, which includes indirect shares (via) that were previously
   missing.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3040
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3135

* Bugfix - Fixed layout of file lists: [#3100](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3100)

   A recent library update in ODS for the recycle scroller seem to have changed the
   logic or calculation of the height.

   This fix accommodates for that change and restores the row height to a correct
   value.

   The shared file lists are now more responsive, the collaborators/owner and share
   time columns are now hidden on small screens.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3100

* Bugfix - Changed share icons to collaborators icons: [#3116](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3116)

   Adjust icon in files app navigation bar and also in the file actions dropdown to
   use the group icon.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3116

* Bugfix - Sorted collaborators column, deduplicate public entry: [#3137](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3137)

   The collaborators column that appears in the "shared with others" section are
   now sorted: first by share type (user, group, link, remote) and then by display
   name using natural sort. Additionally, if there is more than one public link for
   the resource, the text "Public" only appears once in the collaborators column.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3137
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3171

* Bugfix - Use end of the day in expiration date: [#3158](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3158)

   We've changed the expiration date field in the collaborators list to the end of
   the day.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3158

* Change - Align columns in file lists to the right: [#3036](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3036)

   We've aligned columns in all file lists to the right so it is easier for the
   user to compare them.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3036
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3163

* Change - Moved collaborators additional info on own row and removed type row: [#3130](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3130)

   We've moved collaborators additional info on own row under the name of
   collaborator and removed collaborator type row.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3130

* Change - New sort order for collaborators and public links: [#3136](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3136)

   We've changed the sort order for collaborators and public links. Collaborators
   are now sorted by: collaborator type, is collaborator direct, display name and
   creation date. Public links are now sorted by: is public link direct, display
   name and creation date.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3136

* Change - Stop support for deployment of Web as an ownCloud app: [#3162](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3162)

   We've stopped supporting deployment of Web as an ownCloud app. In the release is
   no longer available Web ownCloud 10 app package.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3162

* Enhancement - Expiration date for collaborators: [#2543](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2543)

   We've added an expiration date for collaborators. Users can choose an expiration
   date for users and groups. After the date is reached the collaborator is
   automatically removed. Admins can set default expiration date or enforce it.

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Various fixes for files app in responsive mode: [#2998](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2998)

   Fixed properly alignment of header columns with the body of the files table
   which stays even after resizing. Removed the column label for the actions column
   as it looks nicer.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2998
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2999

* Bugfix - Responsive buttons layout in app bar when multiple files are selected: [#3011](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3011)

   We've fixed the responsive buttons layout in files app bar when multiple files
   are selected where bulk actions where overlapping and height of the buttons was
   increased.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3011
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3083

* Bugfix - Fix accessible labels that said $gettext: [#3039](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3039)

   Fixed three accessible aria labels that were saying "$gettext" instead of their
   actual translated text.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3039

* Bugfix - Fix console warning about search query in public page: [#3041](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3041)

   Fixed console warning about the search query attribute not being available
   whenever the search fields are not visible, for example when accessing a public
   link page.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3041

* Bugfix - Moved resharers to the top of owner collaborator entry: [#3850](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3850)

   For received shares, the resharers user display names are now shown on top of
   the owner entry in the collaborators list, with a reshare icon, instead of
   having their own entry in the collaborators list.

   This makes the reshare situation more clear and removes the ambiguity about the
   formerly displayed "resharer" role which doesn't exist.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3850

* Change - Moved sidebar navigation under top bar: [#3077](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3077)

   We've adjusted the position of the sidebar navigation to be under the top bar.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3077

* Enhancement - Added ability to click file list columns for sorting: [#1854](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1854)

   The sorting mode of the file list can now be changed by clicking on the column
   headers.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1854

* Enhancement - Improved collaborators column in shared file lists: [#2924](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2924)

   Fixed issue with the collaborators column where only one was being displayed in
   the "shared with you" file list. This is done by properly aggregating all share
   entries under each file entry for the list, which now also includes group shares
   and link shares.

   Improved the look of the collaborators by adding avatars and icons there for the
   shares in the collaborators and owner columns.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2924
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3049

* Enhancement - Display decimals in resource size column only for MBs or higher: [#2986](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2986)

   We've stopped displaying decimals in resource size column for sizes smaller than
   1 MB. We've also started displaying only one decimal.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2986
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3051

* Enhancement - Different message in overwrite dialog when versioning is enabled: [#3047](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3047)

   We've added a new message in the overwrite dialog when versioning is enabled.
   This message is intended to make it clear that the resource won't be overwritten
   but a new version of it will be created.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3047
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3050

* Enhancement - Current user entry in collaborators list in sidebar: [#3808](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3808)

   We've added a new entry into the collaborators list in sidebar which contains
   current user.

* Enhancement - Fixed header for files tables: [#1952](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1952)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Fix collaborator selection on new collaborator shares: [#1186](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1186)

   When typing text into the search box for new collaborators, selecting a user and
   a group with identical names was not possible. This was due to the fact that
   when one (group or user) got selected, the other was excluded because of a
   matching name. Fixed by including the share type (group or user) in matching.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1186

* Bugfix - Prevent loader in sidebar on add/remove: [#2937](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2937)

   When adding or removing a public link or collaborator, the respective list view
   sidebar panels briefly hid the panel and showed a loader instead. The UI is
   supposed to show a visual transition of a new list item into the list on adding,
   as well as a visual transition out of the list on deletion. This is fixed now by
   not triggering the loading state on add and remove actions anymore. A loading
   state is only meant to appear when the user navigates to the shares of another
   file/folder.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2937
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2952

* Bugfix - Fix issue with translate function for pending shares: [#3012](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3012)

   The pending shares was wrongly passing in a translation function, which caused
   translations to be missing in the error message but also it broke the general
   translation sync process with Transifex. Thanks to this change the translations
   will be up to date again.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/3012
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3014

* Bugfix - Properly manage escaping of all translations: [#3032](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3032)

   We've stopped escaping translations which contained resource names or user names
   because they can contain special characters which were then not properly
   displayed. We've done this only with translations which are using mustache
   syntax which does escaping on its own so we don't introduce potential XSS
   vulnerability. For all other translations, we've explicitly set the escaping.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3032

* Change - Improve UI/UX of collaborator forms: [#1186](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1186)

   Applied several UI/UX improvements to the collaborator forms (adding and
   editing). - Showing avatars for selected collaborators on a new share and fixed
   styling/layouting of said collaborators in the list. - Added sensible margins on
   text about missing permissions for re-sharing in the sharing sidebar. - Fixed
   alignment of displayed collaborator in editing view for collaborators. - Removed
   separators from the forms that were cluttering the view. - Moved role
   description on role selection (links and collaborators) into the form element.
   Not shown below the form element anymore.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1186

* Change - Display only items for current extension in sidebar menu: [#2746](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2746)

   We've filtered out nav items in the sidebar menu. Now only items for current
   extension will be displayed. In case the extension has only one nav item, the
   sidebar menu is hidden and instead of menu button is displayed the name of
   extension.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2746
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/3013

* Change - Removed filter button in files list header: [#2971](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2971)

   Removed the confusing filter button in the files list header, so the following
   are now removed as well: - ability to toggle files and folders visibility which
   wasn't that useful and not really a requirement - filter text box as it is is
   redundant as one can already use the global search box - ability to hide dot
   files, we'll look into providing this again in the future with an improved UI

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2971

* Change - File actions now always behind three dots button: [#2974](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2974)

   The inline file actions button didn't look very nice and made the UI look
   cluttered. This change hides them behind a three dots button on the line, the
   same that was already visible in responsive mode. The three dots button also now
   has no more border and looks nicer.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2998
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2974

* Change - Improve ownCloud Design System (ODS): [#2989](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2989)

   During the work on this release, there have been several changes in ODS which
   directly affect Web. - Proper text truncate in breadcrumb component. This fixes
   the mobile view of the current folder breadcrumb in the top bar. - New icon
   sizes `xlarge` and `xxlarge` in oc-icon component. Those are used for the `No
   content` messages e.g. when navigating to an empty folder. - Provide new icon
   size `xsmall` and align spinner-sizes with icon-sizes. The `xsmall` icon size
   turned out to be prettier in some places. The size alignments fixed layout
   glitches when removing collaborators or public links. - Fix aria label on
   spinner in oc-autocomplete. Warning were cluttering the JavaScript console when
   adding collaborators. - Reset input on selection in oc-autocomplete, when
   `fillOnSelection=false`. This makes sure that when a new collaborator has been
   selected, the search input field goes back to being blank for a new search.

* Change - Improve visual appearance of upload progress: [#3742](https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/3742)

   - Changed the layout of the upload progress to be a narrow standalone full width
   row below the app top bar. - Transformed textual information into a single row
   below the progress bar and made it very clear that it can be clicked to show
   upload progress details. - Changed layout of upload progress details list items,
   so that the progress bars always have the same width. - Changed visuals of all
   progress bars in upload context to have a narrow outline and the percentage
   numbers inside of the progress bars. - Fixed the calculation of the overall
   upload progress to be weighted by file sizes instead of just adding up
   percentages and dividing by number of uploads.

   https://github.com/owncloud/enterprise/issues/3742

* Enhancement - Add empty folder message in file list views: [#1910](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1910)

   Whenever a folder contains no entries in any of the file list views, a message
   is now shown indicating that the folder is empty, or that there are no
   favorites, etc.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1910
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2975

* Enhancement - Fixed header for files tables: [#1952](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1952)

   We've made the header of files tables fixed so it is easier to know the meaning
   of table columns.

* Bugfix - Transform route titles into real h1 headings: [#2681](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2681)

   We transformed spans that held the page title to h1 elements. In the case of the
   file list, a h1 is existing for accessibility reasons but can only be perceived
   via a screen reader.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2681

* Bugfix - Prevent jumpy behavior when loading user avatars: [#2921](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2921)

   When loading a user avatar, the container size was smaller so as soon as the
   avatar was loaded, it resulted in jumpy behavior. This is fixed now by applying
   the same size to the loading spinner element.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2927

* Change - Bring UI/UX of file links sidebar in line with sharing sidebar: [#1907](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/1907)

   We adapted the UI/UX of the file links sidebar to be in line with the UI/UX of
   the collaborators sidebar. The order of the two sidebars has been reversed
   (collaborators first, file links second). We added info messages to support a
   clear understanding of the purpose of both private and public links. Most
   notably the file links sidebar has no inline forms anymore.

* Change - Join users and groups into a single list in collaborators sidebar: [#2900](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2900)

   Users and groups were shown as two separate lists (users, then groups) in the
   collaborators sidebar. This separation is now removed, i.e. there is only one
   list with all collaborators, sorted by display name (lower case, ascending). On
   equal names groups are shown first.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2900

* Change - Adjusted labels in files list: [#2902](https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2902)

   Renamed "Modification time" to "Updated" to make it look less technical. Replace
   "Create new" with "New" in the "New" menu as it makes it look less cluttered
   when trying to spot a matching entry.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2902
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2905

* Enhancement - Add share indicator for direct and indirect shares in file list: [#2060](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2060)

   We've added the ability for the user to directly see whether a resource is
   shared in the file list. For this, share indicators in the form of a group icon
   and link icon will appear in a new column near the shared resource. The blue
   color of an icon tells whether outgoing shares exist directly on the resource.
   The grey color of an icon tells that incoming or outgoing shares exist on any of
   the parent folders.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2060
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2894
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2877

* Enhancement - Add files list status indicators extension point: [#2895](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2895)

   We've added the ability for the extension to inject custom status indicator into
   files list. New indicators will then appear next to the default one.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2895
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2928

* Enhancement - Add theme option to disable default files list status indicators: [#2895](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2895)

   We've added the option into the theme to disable default files list status
   indicators.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2895
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2928

* Enhancement - Show indirect outgoing shares in shares panel: [#2897](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2897)

   Whenever outgoing shares exist on any parent resource from the currently viewed
   resource, the shares panel will now show these outgoing shares with a link to
   jump to the matching parent resource. This applies to both indirect
   collaborators shares and also to indirect public link shares.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2897
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2929
   https://github.com/owncloud/web/pull/2932

* Enhancement - Add owner and resharer in collaborators list: [#2898](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2898)

   The top of the collaborators list now display new entries for the resource owner
   and the resharer when applicable, and also visible when viewing a child resource
   of a shared folder (indirect share).

=======================================
The following sections list the changes in ownCloud web 0.2.7 relevant to
ownCloud admins and users.

[0.2.7]: https://github.com/owncloud/web/compare/v0.2.6...v0.2.7

Summary
-------

* Bugfix - Display files list only if there is at least one item: [#2745](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2745)
* Bugfix - Register store which is imported instead of required: [#2837](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2837)
* Enhancement - Internal links in app switcher: [#2838](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2838)

Details
-------

* Bugfix - Display files list only if there is at least one item: [#2745](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2745)

   Vue virtual scroll was throwing an error in console in case that the files list
   was empty. We prevent this error by displaying the files list only if there is
   at least one item.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2745

* Bugfix - Register store which is imported instead of required: [#2837](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2837)

   As some extensions export store not as a module we need to handle that case as
   well.

   https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2837

* Enhancement - Internal links in app switcher: [#2838](https://github.com/owncloud/web/issues/2838)

   In case extensions integrates itself into Phoenix core and not as own SPA we
   need to handle the navigation via router-link inside of Web core SPA.
