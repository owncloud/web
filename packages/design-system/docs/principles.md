### Our set of design principles is here to guide us through our decision making process to make appropriate judgments which will lead us to a good product.

## 1. Accessibility over aesthetics
The highest goal we can achieve with our design is to make ownCloud accessible to everyone. By this, we mean not only the accessibility and usability for people with special needs but also the joy and simplicity of using our products for all kinds of users.

## 2. Guide for all
Design is not a question of the isolated button or the singular application. Design for us at ownCloud means creating a comprehensive, holistic experience. With the product ownCloud and with the brand ownCloud. We strive to unify the user experience on all devices and in all environments.

## 3. Always be building
Design for us at ownCloud is the process in which it is created. For us, the tools we work with, the stakeholders we involve and the discussions that evolve are all important components of what the results will become.

We listen to the voices of the many: the voices of the users and the voices of the experienced people in our company, regardless of their position or department.
