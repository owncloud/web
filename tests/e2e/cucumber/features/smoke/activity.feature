      | Alice | Space Admin |

  Scenario: activity
    Given "Alice" creates the following project space using API
      | name | id     |
      | team | team.1 |
    And "Alice" adds the following members to the space "team" using API
      | user  | role     | shareType |
      | Brian | Can view | user      |
    And "Alice" creates a public link of the space using API
      | space | name       | password |
      | team  | space link | %public% |
    And "Alice" creates the following folder in personal space using API
      | name                   |
      | sharedFolder/subFolder |
    And "Alice" uploads the following local file into personal space using API
      | localFile                   | to                        |

    And "Alice" shares the following resource using API

      | sharedFolder | Brian     | user | Can edit without versions | folder       |
    And "Alice" creates a public link of following resource using API
      | resource     | role                      | password |
      | sharedFolder | Can edit without versions | %public% |

    When "Anonymous" opens the public link "Unnamed link"

    And "Anonymous" edits the following resources
      | resource     | content     |
      | textfile.txt | new content |
    Then "Anonymous" should not see any activity of the following resource

      | resource                  | as      |
      | sharedFolder/textfile.txt | new.txt |
    And "Alice" deletes the following resource using the sidebar panel
      | resource  | from         |
      | subFolder | sharedFolder |
    Then "Alice" should see activity of the following resource
      | resource     | activity                                                                 |
      | sharedFolder | %user_alice_displayName% deleted subFolder from sharedFolder             |
