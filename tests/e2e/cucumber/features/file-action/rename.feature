Feature: rename
  As a user
  I want to rename resources
  So I can rename resources from different locations

  Scenario: rename resources
    Given "Admin" creates following user using API
      | id    |
      | Alice |
      | Brian |
    And "Alice" logs in
    And "Alice" creates the following folders in personal space using API
      | name   |
      | folder |
    And "Alice" creates the following files into personal space using API
      | pathToFile         | content      |
      | folder/example.txt | example text |
    And "Alice" shares the following resource using API
      | resource | recipient | type | role     |
      | folder   | Brian     | user | Can edit |
    And "Alice" creates a public link of following resource using API
      | resource | role     | password |
      | folder   | Can edit | %public% |
    And "Alice" opens the "files" app
    And "Brian" logs in
    And "Brian" navigates to the shared with me page
    And "Brian" opens folder "folder"

    # rename in the shares with me page
    When "Brian" renames the following resource
      | resource    | as                 |
      | example.txt | renamedByBrian.txt |
    And "Brian" logs out

    # rename in the public link
    When "Anonymous" opens the public link "Link"
    And "Anonymous" unlocks the public link with password "%public%"
    When "Anonymous" renames the following resource
      | resource           | as                     |
      | renamedByBrian.txt | renamedByAnonymous.txt |

    # rename in the shares with other page
    And "Alice" navigates to the shared with others page
    And "Alice" opens folder "folder"
    When "Alice" renames the following resource
      | resource               | as             |
      | renamedByAnonymous.txt | renamedByAlice |
    And "Alice" logs out
