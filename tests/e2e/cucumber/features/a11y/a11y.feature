Feature: Accessibility

  As a user with limited accessibility 
  I want to be able to access all features of oCIS
  So that regardless of my abilities and circumstances, I can benefit from oCIS


  Background:
    Given the following users exist
      | id    |
      | Admin |
      | Alice |
    And the following files have been uploaded and tagged accordingly
      | file           | tag  |
      | lorem.txt      |      |
      | testavatar.png | test |
    // maybe also define which files have been shared with which user?

    
  Scenario: check accessibility of login page

  Scenario: check accessibility of shares
