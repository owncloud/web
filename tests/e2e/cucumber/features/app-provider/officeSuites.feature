Feature: Integrate with online office suites like Collabora and OnlyOffice
  As a user
  I want to work on different docs, sheets, slides etc.., using online office suites like Collabora or OnlyOffice
  So that the collaboration is seamless
  # To run this feature we need to run the external app-provider service along with wopi, OnlyOffice, Collabora services
  # This is a minimal test for the integration of ocis with different online office suites like Collabora and OnlyOffice

  Background:
    Given "Admin" creates following users using API
      | id    |
      | Alice |
