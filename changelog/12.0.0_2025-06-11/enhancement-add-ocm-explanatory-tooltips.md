Enhancement: Add OCM explanatory tooltips

We added two contextual helpers to the Connections panel in the OCM app.

- The first one is for the "User" column header.
- The second one is for the "Institution" column header.

The contextual helpers are used to provide additional information about the columns.

The "User" column header tooltip reads:

> This is the user the federation is set up with, and the one you can share resources with.

The "Institution" column header tooltip reads:

> This URL represents the trusted partner's instance.
