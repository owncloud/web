Enhancement: Add maintenance banner

We've added a maintenance banner to the web app. This banner is displayed when any request responds with 503 status code. The banner displays a short message notifying the user that the system is in maintenance mode. The banner is also clickable and will open a modal with more details about the maintenance mode.
