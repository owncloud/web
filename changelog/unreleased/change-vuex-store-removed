Change: Vuex store removed

BREAKING CHANGE for developers: The vuex store has been removed in favor of pinia.

All store modules have been migrated to a pinia store module. Please see the linked issue down below for a list of all migrated stores and how to use them now.

There are a number of things that have been removed and/or moved into pinia composables instead:

Globals:

- `store` and `$store` variables have been removed.
- `ConfigurationManager` has been removed. The config now sits inside the configuration store.

App framework:

- `announceStore` has been removed. There is no need for apps to announce stores to the runtime. If you need to use a store in your app, simply create a pinia store module and use it.
- `announceExtensions` has been removed. The proper way for an app to register file extensions is via the `extensions` property inside the `appInfo` object.
- `requestStore` has been removed. There is no need to request specific stores. All stores that `web-pkg` provides can be imported and accessed via their composables.
- `enabled` callback as well as the `name` callback of the `AppNavigationItem` no longer have the `capabilities` parameter.
- `store` param of the `ClassicApplicationScript` has been removed.

Composables:

- `useStore` has been removed. Use the pinia for the store you want to use instead.
- `useAccessToken` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store.
- `usePublicLinkContext` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store.
- `usePublicLinkPassword` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store.
- `usePublicLinkToken` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store.
- `useUserContext` has been removed. It now sits inside the auth store.
- `useConfigurationManager` has been removed. The config now sits inside the configuration store.
- `use...Capability` composables have been removed. Capablities now sit inside the capability store.
