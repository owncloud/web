Enhancement: Add instance switcher

Added a list of users' instances to the user menu. When multiple instances are enabled in oCIS, the user can switch between instances by clicking on the instance in the list.
The list displays maximum 3 instances. If there are more instances, the user can click on a button to open the instances modal. Within the modal, the user can see all instances and switch between them by clicking on the instance or a "Switch" button.
