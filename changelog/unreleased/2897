Enhancement: Show indirect outgoing shares in shares panel

Whenever outgoing shares exist on any parent resource from the currently viewed resource,
the shares panel will now show these outgoing shares with a link to jump to the matching parent
resource.
This applies to both indirect collaborators shares and also to indirect public link shares.
