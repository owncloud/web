Enhancement: Sidebar menu selected for different kinds of personal volumes

The current implementation hardcodes the naming of the volumes and assumes that the personal volume always starts with `personal/`, which might not be the case.
With this enhancement, the selection of the menu happens if the corresponding type of space is selected as well.
