Enhancement: Accessibility improvements

The following accessibility improvements have been made:

- Contextual helpers now have a focus trap, meaning the user can't focus elements in the background while the contextual helper is showing.
- An issue where the current focus would not change when navigating the resource table/tiles with the keyboard has been fixed.
- The contrasts of input borders have been aligned with the official WCAG requirements.
- The space member search in the right sidebar now has a label. Also, the search has been moved from the top of the sharing panel to the members section where all members are listed.
