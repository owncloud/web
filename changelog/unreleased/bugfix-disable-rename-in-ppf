Bugfix: Disable rename action in password-protected folder view

We've fixed a bug where renaming a folder from inside a password-protected
folder view would create a duplicate folder instead of renaming the original.
The rename action is now hidden in public link contexts, which aligns with
the documented behavior that link files should not be manipulated from this view.
