Enhancement: Dynamic theme-color meta tag based on loaded theme

The theme-color meta tag now dynamically uses the brand color from the
currently loaded theme instead of a hardcoded value. This improves
Safari's tab bar styling to match custom themes and provides a more
cohesive branded experience.
