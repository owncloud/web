Enhancement: Visual improvement to errors in input prompts

We've adjusted the input prompts to show a visually less prominent text below the input field.
Also, error messages now appear with a small delay, so that those happening during
typing get ignored (e.g. trailing whitespace is not allowed in folder names and previously caused
an error to show on every typed blank).
