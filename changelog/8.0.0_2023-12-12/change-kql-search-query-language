Change: Keyword Query Language (KQL) search syntax

We've introduced [KQL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sharepoint/dev/general-development/keyword-query-language-kql-syntax-reference) as our default query language.
Previously we used our own simple language for queries which is now replaced by kql.

`sample.tx* Tags:important Tags:report Content:annual*`

becomes

`name:"sample.tx*" AND tag:important AND tag:report AND content:"annual*"`

by default KQL uses `AND` as property restriction and the query described above can also be formulated as follows

`name:"sample.tx*" tag:important tag:report content:"annual*"`

More advanced syntax like grouping combined with boolean property restriction is supported too

`(name:"sample*" name:"*txt") tag:important OR tag:report content:"annual*"`

BREAKING CHANGE for developers: the term which will be passed to the `search` method of search providers is now wrapped inside `name:"..."`. If you don't want that behaviour you need to strip it out, e.g. via simple regex: `const rawTerm = term.match(new RegExp('name:"\\*(.*?)\\*"'))`.
