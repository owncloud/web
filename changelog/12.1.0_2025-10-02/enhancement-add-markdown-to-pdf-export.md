Enhancement: Add markdown to PDF export

Added a new file action which allows exporting a markdown files as a PDF.
Users can export the markdown file as a PDF by clicking on the new action in the context menu inside the markdown editor.
Users are able to choose a location and a name for the exported PDF file.
The export is done in the background and the user is notified when it is ready.
