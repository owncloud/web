Bugfix: Search Text Overalps With Search Icon In The Search Bar

We have fixed an issue where the search text in the search bar would overlap with the search icon, making it difficult to read. This improvement enhances the user experience by ensuring that the search text is clearly visible and does not interfere with the functionality of the search icon.
